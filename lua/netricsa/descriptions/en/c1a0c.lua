BLACK MESA, CASCADE RESONANCE


Sam, the experiment has collapsed in exactly the way I feared. The crystal insertion triggered a catastrophic energy surge, resulting in what the scientists called a cascade resonance. In simpler terms: the walls between dimensions have been torn apart.

Telemetry confirms the presence of a massive interdimensional entity - designation Nihilanth. Historical records identify him as a former lieutenant of Mental during the early expansion wars. However, something has changed: instead of serving, Nihilanth has declared independence. What we are witnessing is no longer an experiment gone wrong - it is a battlefield between two cosmic powers.

The results are catastrophic. Hallways are in ruins, entire laboratories collapsed, and bodies of both scientists and guards are scattered everywhere. The resonance is still destabilizing the environment, pulling creatures from alien worlds into Black Mesa. In short: chaos has taken root, and you are in the middle of it.

Sam, this facility is no longer a lab. It is a war zone. And unlike Sirius, this time the enemy is not only Mental - but also one of his oldest traitors.
