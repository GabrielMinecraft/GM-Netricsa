BLACK MESA, ANOMALY OFFICES


These not are the same offices.

Inside, you'll encounter controllers hovering through the halls, their psychic blasts. Vortigaunts patrol the corridors, hurling lightning at anything that moves, and scattered H.E.C.U. squads are desperately trying to hold their ground. To make things worse, alien parasites infest the vents and side rooms - perfect for ambushes.
