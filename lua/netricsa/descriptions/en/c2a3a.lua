BLACK MESA, ICHTHYOSAUR'S LAIR



Sam, welcome to the flooded research basin. Scanners confirm you're not alone - deep below the surface, something massive is moving. Identification: Ichthyosaur, an aquatic predator from Xen. Speed: extreme. Appetite: bottomless. Probability of survival if you swim unarmed: let's not calculate that.

Above the waterline, a small maintenance bridge still holds. On it, a Black Mesa scientist waves desperately, trapped between the flooded lab and the monster-infested waters. His odds of survival without your intervention are... mathematically irrelevant.

The Ichthyosaur circles like a shark, waiting for you to dive. Every splash will draw it closer, every second underwater raises the risk of becoming its lunch. Standard weapons will be difficult to use here - visibility is poor, and recoil is unreliable. You'll need to get creative if you want to outmaneuver it.
