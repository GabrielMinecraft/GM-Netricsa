HATSHEPSUT


After traveling back in time, we landed, as expected, in a great temple at Dayr el-Bahri, built by a female Egyptian ruler, Hatshepsut. Time travel has caused some atmospheric turbulence, but I expect the weather will calm down in a few moments.

We know a little about the Sirians. They preserved their knowledge and enabled Timelock, but their life in ancient Egypt is still a mystery to us. You have to find out more about the Sirians, and maybe it will help us discover and destroy the evil that attacked Earth.

This is the plan. Ancient Egypt had two centers of power. One was a civic town, called Memphis, the greatest city of its time. The second is Thebes, a sacred place and the heart of the Egyptian religion. Memphis rulers, unsatisfied with power and influence of the religious people in Thebes, started a riot. During the riot, Thebes was invaded and robbed. Afterwards, survivors locked all the doors of Thebes with their magic powers. Now, only the one that finds four magic elements can enter Thebes. I am sure that in one of these centers we will find the answers to our questions.

This riot was also the beginning of the end for the Egyptian Empire. Torn apart with the battles for power, exhausted in wars with many countries that they conquered. Without any help from their Gods, they started losing countries one by one, until the final fall of the Egyptian Empire. They never rose from the ashes again. 

First of all, we have to find the four magic elements. They are placed in catacombs within these mountains. Closest to us is the Temple of Thutmose I, father of Hatshepsut. To proceed there, you must enter this great mountain.
