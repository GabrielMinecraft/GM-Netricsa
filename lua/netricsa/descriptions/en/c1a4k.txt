BLACK MESA, PIPEWORKS


Sam, the path forward takes you into the underbelly of the facility-an endless maze of industrial pipes and drainage systems. Down here, it's less about gunfire and more about survival against the environment itself. Acid leaks are corroding the metalwork, turning the floor into glowing green puddles of death. Try not to fall in, unless you've always dreamed of becoming a skeleton in record time.

Unfortunately, you're not the only one enjoying this chemical spa. Bullsquids have claimed the lower levels, using the pipes as both cover and ambush points. They spit acid with deadly accuracy, and unlike the puddles, this acid moves. Watch the shadows above and below-these creatures love to attack from blind spots.

Recommendation: move fast, keep your footing, and remember-acid burns hurt less when the one doing the burning is already dead.
