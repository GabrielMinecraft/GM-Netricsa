BIG CITY,  URBAN EXPANSE


Big city is exactly what its name suggests: a sprawling metropolis designed for chaos. Wide avenues, towering skyscrapers, industrial blocks, and endless rooftops form a massive sandbox environment. Unlike the confined test areas of Construct or the emptiness of Flat grass, Big city thrives on verticality and scale.

Key features include:

Downtown core with skyscrapers and open plazas, perfect for rooftop chases and sniper nests.

Industrial zones with warehouses, tunnels, and hidden underpasses.

Highways and bridges for vehicle testing and large-scale battles.

Rooftops and interiors that allow for creative traversal and ambushes.

This is the city that never sleeps â€” but also never had any real citizens. Empty streets echo with the sound of your own footsteps, leaving the unsettling impression.
