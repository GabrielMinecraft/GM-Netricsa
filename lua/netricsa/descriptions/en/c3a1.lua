BLACK MESA LAMBDA COMPLEX, THE LONG APPROACH


Hallelujah - the Lambda Complex at last. The beacon, the sanctuary, the one place in this whole nightmare where the scientists still have a plan. Problem is, between you and them lies everything else that doesn't want you to make it.

The path is not a welcoming hallway but a gauntlet: collapsed labs, half-flooded corridors  of both literal and metaphorical kind. H.E.C.U. units still cling to positions here, determined to bury the evidence - and you along with it. Mental's creatures slip through fresh portals, competing with Xen fauna already entrenched. The result is a three-way war, and you're expected to walk straight through the middle.

Sensors indicate the core Lambda staff remain alive, barricaded in an inner chamber. They have the key to stabilizing (or escaping) this catastrophe - but they're outnumbered, outgunned, and cut off from supplies. Reaching them isn't just survival; it's the only hope for closure.
