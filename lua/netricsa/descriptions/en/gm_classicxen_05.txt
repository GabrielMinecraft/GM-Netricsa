XEN, NIHILANTH'S FACTORY


After passing through the portal, we arrived at one of the most critical sites in Xen: the Factory of Nihilanth. This is no simple stronghold, but a living machine - a place where alien technology and organic matter fuse into one endless cycle of production.

The atmosphere is suffocating. Every wall pulses like flesh, conduits throb with energy, and the air vibrates with the constant hum of machinery. Vortigaunts, bound by psychic chains, are forced to operate massive devices - raising platforms, powering conduits, and maintaining the vats where entire armies are grown.

This is the origin of the alien infantry. Shock troopers, grunts, even the armored guardians are bred here, shaped in biocapsules, and prepared for endless war.

As we entered, his voice struck the air:

"We are all slaves... We are all slaves... We are all..."

Nihilanth himself knows the truth - he is as much a prisoner as those he enslaves.
