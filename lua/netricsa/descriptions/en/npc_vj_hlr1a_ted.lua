DESCRIPTION:

Ted Barney is a loyal Black Mesa security guard. Equipped with standard issue weapons and light armor, he helps defend personnel and facility areas. He reacts quickly to threats but is not as heavily trained or resilient as H.E.C.U. or special forces operatives.

Ted is dependable in combat situations but should be supported in larger firefights due to limited endurance.

TIPS:

- Keep him near for support.
- Use cover - he cannot survive heavy fire alone.
- Effective at defending corridors and checkpoints.
