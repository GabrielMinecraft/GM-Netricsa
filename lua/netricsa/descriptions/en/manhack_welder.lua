MANHACK WELDER


WEAPON:      Manhack Dispenser
AMMO:        Manhacks (autonomous flying blades)
ROF:         ~1 spawn/sec

DESCRIPTION:

Weaponized tool that deploys small autonomous flying blades "manhacks" to attack enemies. Once released, manhacks seek out targets and deal continuous slashing damage until destroyed or recalled. Useful for area control and harassment.

Secondary firing mode of the Manhack Gun. Deploys a small, spherical explosive mine instead of a manhack. The mine detonates on proximity to enemies, providing area damage and strategic control over choke points.

NOTES:

- Unlimited spawns as long as manhacks are available in ammo pool.
- Can harass or distract multiple enemies simultaneously.
- Effective in confined spaces where manhacks can track targets.
- Requires situational awareness to avoid friendly fire or self-damage.
