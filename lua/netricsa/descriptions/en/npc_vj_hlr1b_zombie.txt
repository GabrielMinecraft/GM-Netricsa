DESCRIPTION:

When a Purple Headcrab successfully infects a human, it creates a Zombie variant that is stronger and more resilient than common headcrab zombies. The purple parasite alters the host's tissue, giving it increased endurance and a grotesque alien appearance. These zombies are slow but relentless, often forming coordinated hordes.

TIPS:

- Firearms or explosives are effective due to their slow speed.
- Avoid close contact - melee attacks are dangerous.
- Groups can corner; prioritize targets.
