BLACK MESA, COLLAPSING PIPE


Sam, progress takes you across what the engineers of Black Mesa generously called a maintenance pipe. In reality, it's a rusty cylinder barely strong enough to hold its own weight, let alone yours.

Naturally, halfway through, the inevitable happens: the pipe groans, bends, and then collapses. You fall straight through into the next chamber.

Hazards relief:

Impact zone contains a lone headcrab lurking under a desk, apparently waiting for the perfect ambush.

Instead, it gets the full weight of a Serious Sam falling from above.

Result: one very flat headcrab and one very confused Sam, dusting himself off.

The pipe is gone, the headcrab is gone, but your path forward is open. Just remember-if the infrastructure here is already collapsing under its own weight, imagine what it'll look like when more portals keep tearing reality apart.
