BLACK MESA, SURVIVOR TESTIMONY


Sam, you've made contact with one of the surviving scientists. And yes-he insists on calling you Freeman. I tried correcting him, but he seems convinced the mustache and sneakers are just a "new lab look."

Here's what he told us: to stop this catastrophe, you need to reach the Lambda Complex at the far end of Black Mesa. According to him, that's where the last remaining researchers are regrouping, and they may have a plan to shut down the interdimensional rift. He also swears that everyone in Lambda can be trusted-no secrets, no double agents, no surprises. Which, considering the day you're having, is either comforting... or suspicious.

Complication: the main Black Mesa transit system is fried. Trams, elevators, even half the cargo lifts are out of commission. Your only viable route is the rail cargo line beyond the storage facility. But there's a catch: to get there, you'll have to cross through the rocket test sector, and every tunnel leading in that direction is crawling with hostiles.

So, the plan is simple (and by simple I mean borderline insane): hijack a freight train, navigate through missile silos, and hope it leads you to what's left of Lambda Team.

Recommendation: take the scientist's words at face value-Lambda is your best shot at ending this nightmare. But be ready, Sam: trust is good, firepower is better.
