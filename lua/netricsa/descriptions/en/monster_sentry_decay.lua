DESCRIPTION:

The Heavy Sentry Turret is an upgraded model of the standard H.E.C.U. defense unit, deployed in highly restricted areas such as the Decay facility. Unlike its weaker counterpart, this turret is reinforced with thick armor plating, allowing it to withstand sustained gunfire and resist small explosives. Its targeting system is faster, and its weapon delivers heavier bursts, making direct confrontation extremely dangerous.

What makes this version especially lethal is its self-destruct mechanism: when destroyed, the Heavy Sentry detonates in a violent explosion, ensuring that even a victorious attacker may not leave unscathed. This makes tactical engagement a necessity - brute force often results in mutual destruction.

TIPS:

- Keep distance - destruction triggers an explosive blast.
- Use long-range weapons to disable safely.
- Direct melee or close-quarter combat is suicidal.
- Heavy cover and careful timing are essential for survival.
