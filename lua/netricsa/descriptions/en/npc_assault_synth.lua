DESCRIPTION:

The Assault Synth is a Combine concept unit - a fast, four-legs biomechanical construct engineered for coordinated battlefield strikes. Standing roughly 5 feet tall, these synths are compact enough to swarm and overwhelm infantry forces. Their four agile limbs allow for exceptional mobility, enabling them to run at high speeds and outmaneuver defenders.

They are often deployed alongside Crab Synths, acting as rapid skirmishers that complement their larger counterpart's heavy assault role. While individually fragile compared to major synths, in groups they become a serious threat, harassing infantry and softening defenses for heavier Combine units.

TIPS:

- Stay alert when Crab Synths are present - Assault Synths usually accompany them.
- Area-of-effect weapons (grenades, shotguns) are the most effective counter.
