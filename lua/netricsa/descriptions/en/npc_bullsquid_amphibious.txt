DESCRIPTION:

The Amphibious Bullsquid is a rare aquatic subspecies of the feral Bullsquid from Xen. Unlike its terrestrial relatives, this beast has adapted to deep waters, with a muscular crocodile-like frame, green scaly hide, and only four powerful feeding tentacles around its maw. Its amphibious lungs allow it to thrive both underwater and on land, though it prefers lurking in rivers, canals, and flooded caverns.

When provoked, the Amphibious Bullsquid attacks with vicious claws, tail strikes, and streams of toxic spit even while submerged. Its crocodilian build grants it strong swimming speed, making it an apex predator in both domains.

TIPS:

- Avoid entering water when Amphibious Bullsquids are presentâ€”they ambush from below.
- Toxic spit disperses quickly in water, so keep distance even when swimming.
- Explosives and harpoon-like weapons are most effective underwater.
- Land combat is safer, but their charging bite can crush bone in seconds.
