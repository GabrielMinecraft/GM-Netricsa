XL-808 PLASMA RIFLE


WEAPON: XL-808 Plasma Rifle
AMMO:   X8 Plasma Cells
ROF:    ~400 rounds/min


DESCRIPTION:

The XL-808 is a high-energy plasmatic rifle built for area suppression and crowd control. It fires dense bursts of plasma at a high rate; projectiles exhibit a slight tendency to "stick" to organic targets, improving hit effectiveness against moving enemies.


NOTES:

- Excels at mowing down hordes and holding choke points
- Watch ammo consumption.
