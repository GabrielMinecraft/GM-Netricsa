DESCRIPTION:

The Rebel Engineer is a crucial support unit within the human Resistance. Trained in both combat and engineering, they wield a Charge Bow for long-range precision attacks and can deploy Combine turrets reprogrammed to defend rebel positions. These turrets act as stationary heavy fire support, providing a force multiplier for small squads.

Rebel Engineers are agile and resourceful, often flanking enemies to set up turrets or secure strategic positions. Their technical expertise allows them to hack and repurpose Combine machinery, making them indispensable for field operations.

TIPS:

- Prioritize eliminating enemy engineers first-they can turn defenses against you.
- Protect deployed turrets-they provide continuous fire support.
- Use their mobility to place turrets in unexpected locations.
- Charge Bow is deadly at range, capable of penetrating light armor.
