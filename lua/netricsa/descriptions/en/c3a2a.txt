BLACK MESA LAMBDA REACTOR, THE SCIENTIST'S WARNING


Before you leave, the scientist explains that the only way forward is through the reactor's flooded access shaft. The pumps must be activated to raise the water level, giving you enough to swim inside. No soldiers are down here - not because of luck, but because this is the only open entrance left. Every other access point has been sealed off. They were waiting you.

Directive:

Activate the pumps.

Raise the water level.

Swim inside the reactor.

From here on, the soldiers are gone. What waits ahead is worse.
