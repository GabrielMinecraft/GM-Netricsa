THE SIMBA ALLIANCE


The Simba are intelligent, blue-skinned humanoids native to the planet M'Digbo. Their civilization combines ancient wisdom and technological ingenuity: they build majestic cities and create complex mechanisms and weaponry, while maintaining harmony with the natural environment of their home planet.

The Simba are freedom-loving and intelligent. They unite in tribes and cities led by chieftains and shamans, where every member of society is valued and can contribute. They create weapons and technology to defend their homeland and allies: flying machines, homing devices, and trained fighting units capable of repelling attacks from Mental's Horde.

In the galactic war, the Simba are part of the Alliance, joining forces with other races striving to preserve life and order in the universe. Their strategy is not based on numbers, but on intelligence, discipline, and flexibility. Every Simba knows the price of freedom and is ready to fight to the end to protect their home world and allies.
