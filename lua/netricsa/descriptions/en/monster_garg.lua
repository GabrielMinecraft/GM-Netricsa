DESCRIPTION:

The Gargantua is a towering, fire-spewing behemoth from Xen. Its muscular, armored body allows it to shrug off small arms fire while it incinerates foes with its flamethrower-like arms. Despite its size, it is surprisingly fast and can leap to crush intruders with devastating force.

Gargantuas are solitary hunters but incredibly territorial. They appear almost unstoppable, forcing even the most confident resistance fighters to rethink frontal assaults. Their terrifying combination of firepower and raw strength makes them apex predators in any Xen environment.

TIPS:

- Keep distance: flamethrowers can melt most cover.
- Use explosives and heavy weaponry; conventional guns are nearly useless.
- Environmental hazards like collapsing structures can help even the odds.
