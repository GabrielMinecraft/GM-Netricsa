BLACK MESA LAMBDA COMPLEX, LAST H.E.C.U. STAND


The sewers , and what waits above is the last H.E.C.U. detachment still clinging to orders.

They've dug in hard: a defensive perimeter, heavy machine guns, and a full M1 Abrams parked like a stubborn monument to their fading strength.

Intel chatter confirms it: command told them to forget about Freeman. He's no longer their problem. But here's the truth - everything is their problem now. They're bleeding men, losing ground, and watching Black Mesa slip away inch by inch. The front is collapsing, and these soldiers know it.

That doesn't make them less dangerous. Desperation fuels recklessness, and the Abrams can turn the street into molten glass with a single shot. Expect them to fight not for victory, but to take someone down with them.

And while they burn out... the Black Ops aren't waiting.

Different uniforms, different orders: silence every witness, erase every trace. They won't waste time holding ground - they'll carve through H.E.C.U., through Xen, through you, until the facility is nothing but corpses and ash.
