BLACK MESA, ELEVATOR


Sam, this sector is a logistics nightmare. The only way forward is through a cargo elevator. Sounds simple, but of course it isn't. While descending, you'll have the pleasure of dodging headcrabs falling from above - apparently gravity is their favorite ambush tactic.

At the bottom, things get even better: the lift shaft connects directly to a garbage compactor. One wrong step, and you'll be turned into Serious meatballs. Timing will be critical if you want to get across safely.

Your objective is to reach the bridge beyond this section. Unfortunately, sensors confirm it's already collapsed. Translation: no easy shortcut. You'll have to detour deeper into the facility until you find the passenger elevator that leads up toward the office blocks.

Recommendation: keep your eyes up for falling parasites, and your feet away from spinning blades. If you survive both, the office workers upstairs will be thrilled to have such a... colorful visitor.
