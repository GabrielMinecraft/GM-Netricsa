DESCRIPTION:

The Diablo is a towering, artificially-engineered abomination created through horrific splicing of human scientists, Chumtoads, Vortigaunt DNA, and Xen crystal matter. Its body glows faintly with violet energy, while its blood remains a disturbing red, betraying its human origin.

Unlike its Pantereye cousins, the Diablo is not just a predator - it is a living weapon, designed to combine feral savagery with ranged crystal energy attacks. Its massive frame looms over lesser creatures, nearly twice the size of a Pantereye, with a broad, armored back crowned by a pulsating crystal crest that channels destructive projectiles.

The Diabloâ€™s presence on the battlefield is overwhelming: its sheer size, deep purple coloration, and crimson blood make it both awe-inspiring and horrifying. It is not a natural Xen beast, but a deliberate experiment in weaponizing evolution, a final stage predator with no natural rival.

TIPS:

- Prioritize cover - its crystal blasts are deadly at range.
- Heavy ordnance (rockets, explosives) are essential to bring it down.
- Keep moving - its melee reach and jump attack is enor
