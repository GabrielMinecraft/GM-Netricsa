BLACK MESA, CANYON STRONGHOLD


Escape to the surface didn't mean freedom - it meant walking straight into H.E.C.U. territory. The desert canyon ahead has been fortified into a kill-zone, with bunkers, sandbags, and mounted guns turning natural rock formations into an improvised battlefield.

Intel confirms a disturbing trend: the first Apache wasn't the end. Another gunship is inbound, ETA minutes. They wonâ€™t stop until this entire sector is reduced to rubble.

Situational overview:

Terrain: open canyon floor with limited cover, surrounded by sheer cliffs. Movement is predictable, which makes you an easy target for machine guns and rockets.

Forces: multiple squads of H.E.C.U. entrenched with turrets and explosive charges pre-placed along the canyon walls.

Air threat: a second Apache inbound. This one will likely coordinate with ground troops for maximum suppression.
