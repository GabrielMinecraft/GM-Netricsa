DESCRIPTION:

The Hybridsquid is an albino mutation, built for speed and ranged combat. Unlike its cousins, it avoids close range, spitting concentrated white plasma bolts across long distances. Its agility makes it nearly impossible to hit.

TIPS:

- Use rapid-fire weapons to track and suppress its movement.
- Avoid long open spaces - it dominates at range.
- Traps and explosives are the best way to pin it down.
