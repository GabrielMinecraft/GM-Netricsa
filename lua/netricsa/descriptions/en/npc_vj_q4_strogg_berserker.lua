DESCRIPTION:

The Berserker is a fearsome Strogg unit designed to dominate close quarters. It's faster than many Stroggs, built for speed and brutal melee combat. With a sharp blade arm, a powerful mace, and the ability to generate electric shockwaves either through the ground or by firing lightning bolts, it can catch opponents off guard and close distance quickly. 


It often charges directly at its target, ignoring ranged engagements unless necessary. It hops, dodges, and uses its shockwave attacks to disrupt cover or flush out enemies from hiding.

TIPS:

- Don't try to outrun it; itâ€™s too fast. Best to keep distance. 
- Use weapons with high fire rate or shotgun at close range. Aim for head hits to maximize damage.
