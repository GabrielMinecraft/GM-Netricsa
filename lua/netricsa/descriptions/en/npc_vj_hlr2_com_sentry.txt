DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Sentry Gun is an autonomous defense platform widely deployed across occupied territories. Mounted on a tripod base and powered by a compact Combine energy core, it can lock onto targets using motion and thermal detection systems, making it nearly impossible to sneak past.

Its dual pulse cannons unleash devastating suppressive fire, forcing enemy infantry into cover. Typically placed in choke points, corridors, and prison sectors like Nova Prospekt, these sentry guns provide relentless firepower and psychological intimidation, their humming and mechanical clicks signaling imminent death.

Though designed for maximum lethality, they lack mobility and depend on Combine Engineers for deployment and maintenance. Once positioned, however, they can hold entire sectors against human resistance.

TIPS:

- Use explosives or EMP-style attacks to disable them quickly.
- Avoid direct firefights; instead, flank their blind spots.
