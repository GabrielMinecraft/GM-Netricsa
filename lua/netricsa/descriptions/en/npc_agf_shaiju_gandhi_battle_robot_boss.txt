DESCRIPTION:

Developed by the engineers of Lord Anton, the MARK 1 Combat Robot was designed as a frontline guardian of invasion bases. Its hulking frame is armed with twin rotary miniguns, mounted on each side of its armored chassis. These weapons unleash devastating torrents of bullets, shredding through infantry and vehicles alike.

However, this overwhelming firepower comes at a price: the twin barrels are prone to overheating after sustained fire. When he flamed occurs, the machine enters a brutal berserk mode - its systems igniting with energy flames, driving it into a rampage where it disregards tactical logic and charges enemies head-on.

The MARK 1 is feared not only for its weaponry, but for its sheer durability and relentless aggression. Wherever these guardians are deployed, survival becomes a test of fire and steel.

It is also worth noting that this machine is capable of grabbing opponents and throwing them back at decent distances. There is a weak spot on the back.

TIPS:

- Use the overheating weakness: force it to fire continuously until systems falter.
- Avoid close quarters when it enters berserk mode.
- Heavy explosives or armor-piercing weapons are essential to bring it down.
