DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Civil Protection Elite represents the upper echelon of Metropolice forces, serving as the transition step between standard Civil Protection and full Overwatch soldiers. Outfitted with reinforced armor plating and more advanced comms gear, they are deployed in riot suppression, large-scale patrols, and high-priority raids against resistance cells.

Unlike common Metro Cops, these elites have undergone heavier conditioning and augmentation, making them stronger, more disciplined, and deadlier in combat. Their masks feature reinforced filters and darker tones, often with enhanced optics to give them an intimidating appearance.

In battle, Civil Protection Elites operate with better coordination and heavier firepower, using suppressive tactics to flush enemies from cover. They are still not as durable as true Overwatch infantry but represent a serious escalation when deployed in occupied cities.

TIPS:

- Often lead squads of regular CP officers.
- If encountered, more Combine reinforcements may not be far behind.
