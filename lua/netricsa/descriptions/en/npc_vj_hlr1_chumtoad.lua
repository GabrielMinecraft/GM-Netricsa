DESCRIPTION:

The Chum-Toad is a small, amphibian-like Xen creature with a rotund body, Big Eye and stubby limbs. Though once theorized by Black Mesa scientists to be related to Headcrabs due to its squat form, the Chum-Toad is more of a harmless curiosity than a predator. Its thick, rubbery hide and faint coloration allow it to survive in damp Xen caverns and laboratory enclosures.

Some specimens were brought into Black Mesa for study, where they were observed as largely docile. Unlike most Xen fauna, Chum-Toads are not designed for combat - they are bottom-feeders and scavengers.

Interestingly, their genetic material has been used in horrific experiments (such as the creation of the Diablo or Magenta Slaves), proving that even the weakest Xen organism can be weaponized.

TIPS:

- Harmless if left alone - they pose no threat to trained personnel.
- Can be ignored in most encounters.
