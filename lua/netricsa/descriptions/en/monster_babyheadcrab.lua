DESCRIPTION:

The Baby Headcrab is the larval stage hatched from the Gonarch, the massive Xen Matriach. At this stage, it is a tiny, wriggling parasite whose main purpose is survival and growth. The species it will eventually become - Standard, Earth, Poison, Fast, Armored, Alpha, or the rare Purple variant - is determined during this stage, influenced by environmental factors and genetic cues from the Gonarch.

Despite its small size, Baby Headcrabs are aggressive and will latch onto any nearby host if given the chance. They are weak alone, but in numbers they can overwhelm intruders.

TIPS:

- Observe carefully - identifying the stage may hint at the eventual threat type.
- Avoid contact; even a single bite.
- Environmental hazards can prevent maturation and control local populations.
