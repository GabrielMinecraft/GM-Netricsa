BLACK MESA, CRUSHING CONVEYORS


The hall stretches endlessly, dominated by wide conveyor belts moving in different directions like arteries of some mechanical beast. Cargo - or what's left of it - rides the belts toward enormous hydraulic presses, which slam down in rhythmic intervals. Miss a step, and you'll share the same fate as the debris already smeared across the belts.

Environmental data:

Parallel conveyors run at different speeds, forcing constant jumps from one to another.

Crushers are timed but unpredictable - sensors suggest some presses are misaligned, striking faster or harder than expected.

Maintenance walkways above the system provide temporary safety, but they're narrow and unstable.

Current threat: creatures from Xen prowl the belts, adapting unnervingly well to the moving platforms. Headcrabs cling to the machinery, Bullsquids fire from across conveyor lines, and in the shadows, larger predators stalk silently, waiting for a misstep.

Recommendation: treat the machinery as much an enemy as the creatures. Movement must be precise, timing perfect. In this sector, survival means becoming part of the machine's rhythm - or being crushed by it.
