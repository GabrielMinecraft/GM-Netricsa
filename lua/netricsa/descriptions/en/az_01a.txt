BLACK MESA, BAD PARALLEL EXPERIMENT


You leapt into their improvised version of the Sirian Key to Eternity. For a moment, it worked - you stood inside Xen again, feeling its weightless air, hearing its endless hum. But before you could act, the Vortigaunts intervened. They dragged you back, hurling you out of the portal and into Black Mesa once more.

At the same time, in another wing, the Anti-Mass Spectrometer collapsed under the "other Sam's" care. The resonance cascade ripped through the facility, and your experiment shattered as well. The prototype Time-Lock detonated - unstable, broken, erased. An alien grunt managed to step through before the blast... only to be torn apart along with the machine itself.

Now, everything is unraveling. The Spectrometer is destructed. The Time-Lock destructed. The whole facility is cracking at the seams. Somewhere out there, the other you is already on the path toward Nihilanth.

Which means you've got a narrow window. Move forward while you still can.

Good news - you don't have to save the world twice. Bad news - you still have to save yourself.
