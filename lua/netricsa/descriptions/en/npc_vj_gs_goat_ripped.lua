DESCRIPTION:

The Ripped Goat of Goatville is the ultimate form of goat chaos - a monstrously muscular beast whose every move leaves destruction in its wake. Unlike the Classic Goat, this one has been pumped with impossible power, making it capable of tossing cars like toys and sending enemies flying across the world with a single headbutt.

It thrives on chaos: flipping vehicles, breaking fences, and demolishing anything unlucky enough to be near. A goat-shaped apocalypse.

TIPS:

- Never confront head-on: its headbutt is lethal.
