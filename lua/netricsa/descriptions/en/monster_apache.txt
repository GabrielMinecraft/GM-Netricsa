DESCRIPTION:

The Apache is a heavily armed military gunship deployed by the H.E.C.U. to eliminate high-value targets and suppress resistance in open areas. Its composite armor shrugs off small-arms fire, and its agility in the air makes it difficult to hit even with heavy weapons. Armed with a rapid-fire chain gun, unguided rockets, and sometimes homing missiles, it can devastate both infantry and vehicles with ease.

The roar of rotor blades followed by incoming fire is a death sentence for anyone caught in the open. Apaches usually coordinate with ground troops, acting as airborne executioners while marines push forward. Direct confrontation without explosives or energy weaponry is futile.

TIPS:

- Cover is your best ally - never fight an Apache in the open.
- Explosives (RPGs or mounted weapons) are the only real counter.
- Homing missiles are deadly - keep moving unpredictably.
- If downed, stay clear - debris and secondary explosions can be lethal.
