DESCRIPTION:

Father Grigori is the last remaining inhabitant of Ravenholm, once a mining town turned necropolis after Combine headcrab shelling. A man of faith twisted by solitude and endless war against the undead, he has become both protector and executioner of the ruined settlement.

Armed with his shotgun Annabelle, Grigori hunts zombies with almost joyous zeal, laughing as he burns, traps, and blasts them apart. Though seemingly mad, he shows genuine kindness to Gordon Freeman, aiding him through Ravenholm's horrors.

Unlike others, Grigori is mysteriously immune to zombification. Headcrab poison affects his body but does not transform him. His blood carries traces of infection, and suggesting that his resistance is temporary, and the corruption inside him grows stronger with time. Until that moment, he embraces his fate as Ravenholm's eternal shepherd, battling the endless tide of the damned.

TIPS:

- He is an ally and will not attack unless provoked.
- His shotgun is extremely powerful-keep distance if hostile.
- Be cautious of his traps scattered across Ravenholm.
- His survival hints at a tragic inevitability-his immunity may not last forever.
