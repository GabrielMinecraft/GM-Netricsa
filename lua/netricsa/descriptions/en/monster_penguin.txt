DESCRIPTION:

This seemingly harmless penguin has been weaponized. A grenade is strapped to its back, ready to detonate when it comes into proximity with a target. Despite its small size, it is surprisingly quick and aggressive, darting toward enemies with a deadly combination of pecks and explosives. Careless encounters can be fatal, as the detonation can severely damage both terrain and nearby allies.

TIPS:

- Keep your distance; the grenade can detonate on contact.
- Use ranged attacks to neutralize it before it reaches you.
- Avoid clustering - one penguin can set off a chain reaction.
