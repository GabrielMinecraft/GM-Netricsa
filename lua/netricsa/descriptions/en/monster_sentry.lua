DESCRIPTION:

The Sentry Turret is an automated weapon platform deployed by military forces to secure chokepoints and corridors. It is compact, folding into a tripod form when inactive, and activates instantly once motion or sound triggers its sensors. Once locked on target, the turret unleashes rapid bursts of machine gun fire with unerring precision.

Although immobile, its lethality comes from ambush placement - turrets are often found in tight corners, blind spots, or bottleneck areas where escape is difficult. The stabilizer frame allows it to fire with deadly accuracy, though sustained damage or explosives can topple it easily.

TIPS:

- Grenades or explosives are the fastest way to disable them.
- Sharp bursts of fire at the base can cause collapse.
- Approach carefully - once alerted, escape is nearly impossible without cover.
