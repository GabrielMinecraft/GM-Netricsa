STROGG RAILGUN


WEAPON: Strogg Railgun
AMMO:   Slug rounds (depleted uranium)
ROF:    ~37.5 rounds/min with cooldown between shots 

DESCRIPTION:

The Railgun is a powerful Strogg weapon. It fires a heavy slug that can one-shot weak enemies and deliver major damage to mid-tiers. However, it suffers from a long cooldown (about 1.6 seconds) between shots, requiring precision and tactical use. Best used as a long-range sniper tool, particularly against individual or armored targets. 


NOTES:

- Penetration upgrade: allows projectiles to pierce through multiple enemies. 
- Small magazine and cooldown make it risky in close quarters.
- Scope significantly improves accuracy; firing from cover recommended.
- Very effective vs Tactical Stroggs and armored units; vulnerable during reload/cooldown.
