DESCRIPTION:

The Mortar Synth is a  artillery organism engineered by the Combine to obliterate resistance strongholds from afar. Its grotesque form resembles a biomechanical insect fused with a siege cannon - the spine arched upward to launch explosive pods over great distances.

Each mortar shot is devastating: acidic bombardment pods burst into corrosive clouds upon impact, burning through armor, fortifications, and flesh alike. While devastating at range, Mortar Synths are slow-moving and less effective in close quarters, relying on their massive bulk to crush any enemy that gets too close.

They are often deployed on the battlefield in tandem with Striders and Crab Synths, providing suppressive fire while heavier assault units advance. Entire resistance bases have been reduced to smoldering craters after prolonged Mortar Synth bombardments.

TIPS:

- Never stay in the open - their bombardment is highly accurate over distance.
- Use hit-and-run tactics; close the distance quickly to avoid prolonged shelling.
- RPGs and explosives aimed at the mortar spine are the most effective counter.
