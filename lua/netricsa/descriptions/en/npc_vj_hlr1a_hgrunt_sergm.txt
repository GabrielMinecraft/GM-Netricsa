DESCRIPTION:

The Alpha H.E.C.U. Sergeant (Melee Specialist) is a brutal close-combat expert, deployed to neutralize resistance in confined areas or when suppressive fire is unavailable. Their reinforced armor allows them to sustain attacks while closing the distance, and their lethal melee skills make them a walking executioner.

Unlike standard marines, these sergeants are trained to bypass cover, leap onto opponents, and incapacitate multiple targets using sheer strength and precision strikes. They often accompany squads of regular H.E.C.U., acting as shock troops to break enemy lines.

TIPS:

- Keep distance - their melee strikes are devastating.
- Explosives or heavy firearms are effective; if available, energy weapons  armaments can even the odds quickly.
- Use environmental hazards or chokepoints to limit their approach; rushing them head-on is suicidal.
