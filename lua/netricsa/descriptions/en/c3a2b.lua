BLACK MESA LAMBDA REACTOR, REACTOR ASCENT


Alright - here's the bit where the water actually helps instead of trying to drown you.

The maintenance pit you're in is a vertical maze of pipes and valves.

Twist the right and left wheel and the water level rises, letting you climb up into the reactor chamber above.

Simple mechanical math. Deadly execution. Oh, and warning - lasers.
