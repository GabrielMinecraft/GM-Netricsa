BLACK MESA, AIRSTRIKE


Sam, congratulations-you finally made it outside. Fresh air, open skies... and a V-22 Osprey circling overhead, spitting out squads of marines like candy from a vending machine. This is the military's first large-scale deployment zone in Black Mesa, and they're treating it like a beachhead.

But here's the twist: the heavy bombardment isn't coming from the Osprey. Sensors confirm long-range artillery strikes-or possibly air-to-ground missiles-from well beyond the facility perimeter. Whoever is pulling the trigger is keeping their distance, which means someone really, really wants this place turned into rubble without getting their hands dirty.

Environmental hazard: wide open ground. Cover is scarce, making you a prime target for both marines and long-range fire. On the plus side, the Osprey has to fly low to drop its troops, which gives you the perfect opportunity to remind it why flying machines and Sam don't get along.

Recommendation: treat the open sky as hostile territory. Use what little cover you can find, thin out the squads as they deploy, and stay sharp.
