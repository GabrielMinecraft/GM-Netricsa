BLACK MESA,  ZOMBIES


Sam, the resonance has opened multiple rifts and unleashed organisms from another dimension. Current scans identify the first wave as headcrabs - small parasitic creatures designed to override the host's nervous system. Once attached, they effectively transform their victims into shambling biological weapons.

You are now moving through corridors filled with these creatures' handiwork. Many of the scientists and personnel you saw only minutes ago are now headcrab zombies. Their bodies are slow and unstable, but the parasites grant them terrifying persistence. Do not underestimate them - they are driven purely by aggression and pain.

I know what you are thinking, Sam: "more monsters, more target practice." And while that is technically correct, remember - every one of these things used to be human. Not that it will stop you, but... you should be aware.

Recommendation: conserve ammunition, but do not hesitate. If Nihilanth is truly behind this invasion, the headcrabs are just the first taste of what he can unleash into this world.
