BLACK MESA REACTOR CORE, LAMBDA LAUNCH


This is it. The last staging ground before Xen. The scientists have gathered on the upper platform, nervously watching the readouts of a device that isn't supposed to exist here - a Time-Lock, reverse-engineered from the Sirian Key of Eternity and jury-rigged into Black Mesa's reactor grid. Once it stabilizes, it will open a controlled bridge into Xen.

The path to them is almost insultingly simple: clear three headcrabs, climb the ladder, and the team will meet you. But don't let that fool you - the real challenge begins when the defense starts.

Mission Parameters:

Protect the lead scientist. He is the only one trained to operate the modified Time-Lock. If he dies, the gateway never stabilizes.

Expect heavy incursion. Both Mental's forces and Xen's creatures sense the rift and will throw everything they have to stop the activation.

Hold until stable. The device requires continuous energy flow for synchronization; interrupting it mid-cycle could cause a catastrophic resonance.

Complications:

Familiar faces. Justin Barnes, Adrian Shephard, and Gordon Freeman himself have been sighted making their way here. The real Freeman - not you, not the confusion. But they're late, and you've already done the heavy lifting. If they arrive at all, it won't be in time to help with this fight.

Limited support. The scientists can only provide you with one tool: a prototype jetpack, designed for extended jumps. It will be necessary once the portal stabilizes. Treat it like gold.
