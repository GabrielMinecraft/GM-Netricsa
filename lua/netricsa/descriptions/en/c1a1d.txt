BLACK MESA, CONTAINERS


Sam, to reach the passenger elevator, you'll have to cross a yawning gap in the facility. The only available "bridge" is a series of suspended cargo containers, dangling above the void like some sadistic obstacle course.

They're unstable, they're swaying, and they were definitely not designed for human foot traffic. But unless you've secretly packed a jetpack in your backpack, jumping from container to container is your only option.

Sensors estimate:

Probability of a clean run - 36%.

Probability of falling and decorating the pit below - 63%.

Probability of container conveniently crushing an enemy for you - 1%.

Recommendation: channel your inner gymnast, ignore your fear of heights, and remember - style points don't count if you splatter at the bottom.
