XEN, THE FALLEN BATTLEFIELD


The deeper you go, the worse it looks.

Mental's forces have found a way in and are tearing the place apart. His creatures clash with Xen's defenders, the ground littered with corpses that never belonged in the same war.

And then, in your head, the voice again - harsher, almost panicked:

"What have you done?"

Nihilanth isn't taunting now. He sounds... afraid.

Your way forward won't be easy. The islands ahead are fractured and floating, and the only way across is by mounting a Manta Ray. Once airborne, you'll need to guide it through the crossfire, dodge hostile fire, and leap onto the next island.

That island holds the portal flickering, but still active. It leads to one of the industrial sectors of Xen, where the real machinery of this dimension grinds away.
