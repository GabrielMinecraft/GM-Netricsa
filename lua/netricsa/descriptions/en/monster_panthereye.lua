DESCRIPTION:

The Panther Eye (or Panthereye) is an alien predator from Xen.
It is intended to function like a predatory feline-capable of crawling, sprinting, and leaping onto victims, using an oddly placed mouth under its chin to pin them down before delivering a vicious bite.

Two visual variants are noted:

Female Blue Panther Eye and Male Red Panther Eye.

TIPS:

- Stay alert: Panther Eyes would rely on stealth and ambush-expect sudden pounces from unseen angles.
- Keep moving: Their speed and leaping ability make stationary targets vulnerable.
- Prioritize elimination in enclosed spaces: A single Panther Eye in tight corridors could be lethal.
