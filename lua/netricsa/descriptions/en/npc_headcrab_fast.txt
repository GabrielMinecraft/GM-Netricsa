DESCRIPTION:

This agile breed of Xen parasite is a leaner, faster cousin of the common headcrab. It attacks in rapid succession, lunging repeatedly. Though its bite lacks the lethality of the poison type, its relentless harassment makes it highly effective in swarms or when backed by other forces. Once it takes control of a host, it produces the terrifying fast zombie.

TIPS:

- Stay calm and time your shots-it only takes one.
- Use high ground; they leap but can't climb well.
