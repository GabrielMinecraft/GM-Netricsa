DESCRIPTION:

The Dreamcast Bullsquid is a rare Xen predator, visually distinct thanks to its unique blue-spotted hide. While genetically similar to the standard Bullsquid, its spotted skin provides eerie camouflage in Xen's bioluminescent landscapes, and its piercing eyes seem to glow with alien hostility. Like its cousins, it hunts anything in sight-using its infamous toxic spit to weaken prey before tearing it apart with claws, tail, and snapping jaws.

TIPS:

- Don't underestimate their ranged spit-it's both painful and disorienting.
- Circle-strafe to avoid the tail swipe.
- Use explosives or rapid fire to bring them down before they close in.
