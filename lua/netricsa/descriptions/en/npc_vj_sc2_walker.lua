DESCRIPTION:

The Walker is one of the most common Lumes. They come in hordes and pursue the Core Guardians whenever they spot them. Individually, they are weak and armored poorly, but their danger comes from numbers. These creatures often spawn in large groups, overwhelming defenses by sheer volume.

Walkers lack any special powers or ranged attacks; they simply march forward, swaying slightly as they move, trying to reach and damage the core. Their weak spot is a small red glowing eye region on their front, which is harder to hit because of their movement. 

TIPS:

- Use crowd control towers or area damage to thin their numbers.
- Target the red weak spot for quicker kills.
