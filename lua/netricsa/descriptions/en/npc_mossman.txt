DESCRIPTION:

Dr. Judith Mossman is a brilliant scientist working with the Resistance, though her loyalties are never clear. While she presents herself as an ally to Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner, and Gordon Freeman, she secretly communicates with Dr. Breen, offering the Combine intelligence on Resistance operations. Ambitious, calculating, and driven by self-preservation, Mossman walks the line between betrayal and redemption.

Her true motives remain conflicted: whether a pragmatic survivor seeking favor with the Combine, or a scientist caught between two sides, her actions shape the course of the Resistance. Despite her duplicity, Mossman ultimately demonstrates moments of courage-such as turning against Breen when Eli's life is at stake.

Mossman is not a soldier, but her intellect and cunning make her dangerous in ways that bullets cannot match. To the Resistance, she is both a liability and a potential savior, depending on which side of her nature prevails.

TIPS:

- Treat her words with caution-her allegiance shifts quickly.
- Monitor her actions, not her promises.
- Despite her betrayals, she has moments of genuine loyalty to humanity's survival.
