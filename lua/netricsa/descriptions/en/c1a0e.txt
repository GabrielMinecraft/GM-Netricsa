BLACK MESA, ANTI-MASS SPECTROMETER


Sam, two senior scientists have intercepted you at the final checkpoint before the test chamber. They are providing what they call a "pre-experiment briefing." In reality, it sounds more like a desperate attempt to convince themselves that this will not end in disaster.

They are instructing you - or rather, the Freeman they believe you to be - to step into the chamber, follow their directions precisely, and insert the crystal sample into the anti-mass spectrometer's beam. Their tone is calm on the surface, but stress levels are obvious: both voices show elevated heart rates, and one of them hesitates before every technical term.

Sam, this is the point of no return. Once you enter that chamber, the experiment begins. If this truly is Mental's doing, then the "accident" they are about to cause is not an accident at all - it is a trigger. For what, I cannot yet calculate.

Recommendation: play the role, stay sharp, and be ready for the moment everything goes wrong. Because it will.
