LASER RIFLE


WEAPON:      Laser Rifle
AMMO:        Energy Beams
ROF:         Double-shot bursts

DESCRIPTION:

Laser Rifle - hand-held laser rifles that discharge twin energy pulses in rapid succession. Though primitive by futuristic standards, these rifles are light, reliable, and perfectly suited for mass deployment on the battlefield. Each pull of the trigger releases two potent laser blasts, delivering swift and deadly suppressive fire.The weapon is powered by a miniaturized plasma core, stabilized with crystalline energy regulators.
This built-in reactor continually reloads the rifle through a magazine inserted into the bottom of the weapon., ensuring ammunition supply in prolonged engagements.

NOTES:

- Lightweight and efficient .
- Each shot drains the plasma core momentarily, but it recharges almost instantly between bursts.
- Designed for swarm tactics: reliable, mass-produced, and deadly in groups.
- Best suited for medium-range firefights; ineffective against heavy armor.
- Designed for light infantry, these weapons deliver moderate damage with impressively fast beam speed and burst synergy.
- Each trigger pull emits a double-shot burst, effectively doubling the impact and making dodging more difficult.
