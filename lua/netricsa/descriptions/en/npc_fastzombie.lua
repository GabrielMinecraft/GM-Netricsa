DESCRIPTION:

Unlike their slower brethren, fast zombies are driven by restless energy. Once a human, their body has been warped by the headcrab into a wiry, skeletal form that moves with terrifying agility. They sprint on all fours and leap across rooftops, shrieking like predators on the hunt. Their endurance is low, but their speed and relentless pursuit make them one of the most unnerving enemies to face.

TIPS:

- Don't let them close the distance.
- Short bursts of fire can stop them mid-charge.
