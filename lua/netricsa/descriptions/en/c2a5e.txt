BLACK MESA, TRIPlE TROUBLE


Stepping out of the missile chamber doesn't mean relief. It means the nightmare just changed scenery.

The outside staging yard is a warzone. A Bradley IFV prowls the asphalt, its turret sweeping with the lazy confidence of a predator that knows it owns the ground. Across the shattered lot, Xen forces have already dug in - Alien Grunts. Soldiers isn't on your side either: more than one Stone Sniper has taken root in upper windows, their rocky silhouettes barely visible until a glint gives them away.

And because misery loves company, radar confirms an Osprey inbound. It's not here yet, but you'll hear the rotors soon enough. Expect it to disgorge another squad of H.E.C.U. onto the battlefield - fresh troops to reinforce the ones already coordinating with the Bradley.
