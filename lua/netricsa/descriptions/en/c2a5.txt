BLACK MESA, BRIDGE ASSAULT


Telemetry confirms heavy rotor signatures - an AH-64 Apache gunship has locked onto your position. The ambush point? A suspension bridge stretched over a deep industrial ravine. Great place for sightseeing... if you ignore the attack helicopter.

Situational analysis:

Threat: the Apache is armed with chain guns, rockets, and the patience of a very angry wasp. Staying in the open is a death sentence.

Environment: the bridge is narrow, partially damaged, and exposed on all sides. Limited cover means you’ll have to keep moving — dodge, weave, and don't stop until you find a stable firing position.

Secondary hazards: H.E.C.U. troops are dug in on both sides of the ravine, providing ground fire support for the gunship. Their coordination suggests this ambush was planned.

Tactical advice:

Use the bridge’s structural beams and broken sections as partial cover, but don't linger.

Prioritize mobility — keep the gunship chasing you instead of circling for easy kills.

If you've secured the Tau Cannon, it’s one of the few weapons capable of putting pressure on an aircraft. Otherwise, scavenging explosive ordnance is your best bet.

Conclusion: crossing this bridge isn’t just about reaching the other side. It's about proving you’re harder to kill than a billion-dollar flying tank.
