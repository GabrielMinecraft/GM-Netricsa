DESCRIPTION:

The Assault Unit represents one of the most dangerous variants of the Invader Robots from Shaidzu-Gandi. Unlike the basic models, these machines are fully equipped with advanced ranged weaponry - most notably a rapid-firing laser assault rifle, capable of cutting down squads of soldiers in seconds.

In addition, they carry enhanced plasma grenades, designed to detonate with devastating force, annihilating infantry and destabilizing armored targets alike. When pressed into close quarters, they can still rely on their crushing mechanical arms, making them lethal at any distance.

Their arrival on Earth marked a turning point in the war: no longer just brutish machines, they became a fully armed invasion force, terrifying in both firepower and resilience.

TIPS:

- Treat them as high-priority targets - their grenades can wipe out groups instantly.
- Maintain cover and use heavy ordnance to break their armor.
- Their laser rifle has pinpoint accuracy: keep moving to reduce its effectiveness.
