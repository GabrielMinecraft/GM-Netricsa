RACE X


Race X are mysterious beings from another dimension, about whom humanity knows only what it would be better not to know. They appeared suddenly, without warning, when the boundaries of worlds were torn apart, and something alien to nature itself entered the rifts of the Black Mesa Facility.

They do not make contact, do not send signals, do not seek allies. Race X invades silently-without treaties, without compromise. Their mere presence is an act of aggression. They can be seen fighting not only against humans, but also against the Xen's Creatures. Their Primary Goal is to exploit Earth's resources for their own interests.
