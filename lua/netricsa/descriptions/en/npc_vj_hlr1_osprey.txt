DESCRIPTION:

The V-22 Osprey is a tiltrotor aircraft used by the H.E.C.U. to rapidly deploy squads into combat zones. Its design allows vertical takeoff like a helicopter, but with the speed and range of a plane. While not heavily armed itself, its true danger lies in the payload it delivers: squads of marines ready to overwhelm survivors with coordinated tactics.

Unlike the Apache, the Osprey rarely engages directly. Instead, it circles above the battlefield, disgorging soldiers via rappelling ropes into hotspots. Destroying it mid-operation can cripple enemy reinforcements, but its armor and evasive maneuvers make it a tough target.

TIPS:

- Focus fire when it hovers to deploy troops.
- Expect waves of reinforcements wherever it appears.
- Explosives and rockets are the most effective counters.
- Taking one down denies the enemy reinforcements - worth the risk.
