DESCRIPTION:

From the distant world of Shaidzu-Gandi, the Invader Robots arrived as the vanguard of a galactic conquest led by their overlord, Lord Anton. These machines were designed not for subtlety but for raw destruction. They do not wield weapons in the traditional sense, but their immense strength allows them to lift and slam enemies into the ground with devastating force.
The first contact with these invaders occurred in Germany, where they appeared as cold, relentless killing machines. Since then, they have begun spreading across the Earth, clashing with the combined resistance of the Third Reich, Russia, Palestine, and the United States.

TIPS:

- Stay mobile - getting caught in their crushing grip is lethal.
- Heavy ordnance is most effective against their armored shells.
- They often attack in groups, overwhelming with brute force.
- Be careful, they may raise their weapons.
