DESCRIPTION:

H.E.C.U. Engineers are combat-trained specialists who actively manipulate the environment to control access and trap intruders. Using welding torches and explosives, they can cut through locked doors to enter restricted areas or seal exits, forcing enemies into confined spaces.

While not frontline fighters, they defend themselves aggressively with pistols and knives, and their ability to manipulate doors makes them unexpectedly dangerous in corridors and enclosed facilities. They often operate in pairs or small groups, securing choke points while the rest of the squad advances.

TIPS:

- Prevent Engineers from reaching doors - they can trap you or flank you otherwise.
- Explosives,or ranged attacks can neutralize them before they finish welding.
- Be aware of surroundings - once a door is sealed, escape routes are limited.
