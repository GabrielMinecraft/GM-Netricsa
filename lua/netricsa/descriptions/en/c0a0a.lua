BLACK MESA, TRAIN - PART 2


Sam, telemetry confirms you are still aboard the Black Mesa transit system. The tram is continuing its descent into deeper sectors of the facility. From what I can determine, this complex is vast - practically a small underground city - with laboratories, reactors, and military checkpoints scattered throughout.

The ride might seem uneventful, but don't be fooled: extended transport sequences in places like this usually indicate one thing - they don't want anyone leaving easily. I detect multiple secured gates, automated scanners, and... wait, I'm reading unusually high energy signatures below. Either they're running a fusion reactor, or someone's compensating for something.

Still no clear signs of Mental's interference - but the probability is high. Too many coincidences: your sudden appearance here, the unstable power grid, the nervous security guards. This may be part of a larger test - whether theirs... or his.

Recommendation: observe and gather intel while the tram moves forward. Something tells me you won't be just a passenger for much longer.
