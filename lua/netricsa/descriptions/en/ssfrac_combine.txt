THE COMBINE


The Combine is a ruthless Empire, existing outside of time and space, having devoured countless worlds and races, uniting their wills, bodies, and technology for a single goal: total conquest and assimilation. The word "Combine" is often heard in deceitful propaganda as "Our Benefactors", but behind this title lies only an iron fist of domination.

They once invaded Earth during the Seven Hour War, exploiting the rifts in the fabric of reality following the Black Mesa disaster.

Within hours, they crushed resistance, imposed their order, and enslaved humanity under the iron rule of "Overwatch", with former Black Mesa administrator Wallace Breen becoming their puppet, becoming the "Administrator" of Earth under their control.

The Combine rule not merely with weapons-they wield fear, technology, and bioengineering. People are transformed into transhumans, their flesh is mixed with synthetics, their minds are reprogrammed, their personalities are erased. Synthents, sentinels, civilian police, city scannersâ€”all parts of a single oppressive machine.

Their cities are not living spaces, but fortresses and cages. Grandiose citadels, reinforced with guards, surveillance, and checkpoints. The cities have no names, only numbers: "City 17," "City 14," "City 10," "City 8"... The Earth, divided into sectors, is under the constant gaze of "Overwatch."
