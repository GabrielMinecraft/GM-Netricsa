DESCRIPTION:

This enormous Manta Ray isn't just a passive Xen creature - it's a flying war machine. It shoots a devastating laser from its chest, capable of obliterating everything in its path, including V-22 Ospreys. Not content with mere destruction, it also drops squads of Vortigaunt slaves and Alien Grunts. Witnessing one of these beasts in action is like seeing a storm of death with wings - beautifully terrifying.

TIPS:

- Stay far away from its chest laser; cover won't save you.
- Watch the sky - it drops enemies from above.
- Fast-moving, deadly, and not shy about using everything at its disposal.
