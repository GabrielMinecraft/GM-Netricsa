BLACK MESA, MILITARY INCURSION 



Sam, the situation has escalated. More H.E.C.U. units are deploying into the  complex, sealing off corridors and executing what they call a "clean sweep." Translation: if it breathes, they'll shoot it. Their tactics are ruthless but efficient-unfortunately for you, "friendly fire" is not in their vocabulary.

But here's the complication: telemetry has picked up signatures belonging to Race X, an entirely different alien faction previously catalogued. These creatures are not part of Xen's hierarchy, nor do they serve Mental. presence here is-probability of contact is extremely low. And yet... they are here.

So far, Race X activity seems minimal: faint portal readings in remote sections of Black Mesa, limited skirmishes with H.E.C.U. patrols. Whether they're opportunists drawn by the resonance cascade, or part of some larger cosmic agenda, remains unclear.

Recommendation: stay alert. Your chance of direct confrontation with Race X is low, but not zero. If you do run into them, remember: they're not here to help anyone. Three alien factions plus the military in one office block-Sam, this is starting to feel less like a rescue mission and more like interdimensional speed dating.
