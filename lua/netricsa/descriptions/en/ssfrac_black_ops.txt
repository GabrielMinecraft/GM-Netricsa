BLACK OPS


Black Ops are a top-secret unit of the US federal government, designed to operate in the shadows. They are elite agents tasked with missions too dirty or dangerous for regular military personnel. Their mission is to conceal the truth, eliminate evidence, and control the situation when official structures are no longer needed.

When the Black Mesa Cascade Resonance disaster occurred, Black Ops were brought into play after the failed H.E.C.U. operation. Their mission is to eliminate anything that could reveal the scale of the incident. This included not only aliens, but also humans, scientists, engineers, soldiers-anyone who could reveal what happened. They act coldly, without further ado.

They are armed with heavy-handed tactics. Sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenades, jamming devices, and sometimes even nuclear weapons-a last resort when it comes to erasing any possibility of information leakage. Their movements are precise, like those of surgeons - nothing superfluous, only what is necessary.
