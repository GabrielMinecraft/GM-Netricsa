BLACK MESA, ACCESS BLOCKED


Sam, here's the situation: the direct maintenance door to both the Power and Fuel control stations is sealed tight. Security logs indicate it auto-locked during the cascade surge, and without clearance codes, it's not opening for anyone-not even you.

Alternative route located: wastewater tunnels running parallel to the silo infrastructure. Yes, that means sewage. Worse, it's not uninhabited. Sensors confirm multiple BullSquids prowling the channels. They thrive in this environment-standing water, low visibility, perfect for ambushes. roars back to life, you'll have the biggest flamethrower on Earth at your disposal. Until then... silence is survival.
