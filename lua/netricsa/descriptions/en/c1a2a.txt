BLACK MESA,  ADMINISTRATION WING


Sam, the office floor has turned into an interdimensional battleground. On one side, squads of Mental's soldiers are storming the cubicles, blasting through drywall and paperwork alike. On the other, Xen creatures-headcrabs, vortigaunts, and assorted nightmares-are pouring in through fresh rifts, tearing into anything that moves.

What was once an orderly administrative wing now looks like a war.

This is no longer just your fight-it's a three-way struggle between humanity, Mental's forces, and Nihilanth's vanguard. The upside? They're too busy killing each other to notice you immediately. The downside? You're still stuck in the middle of an office warzone.

Recommendation: let the two factions soften each other up, then move quickly through the chaos before they remember the real problem is-you.
