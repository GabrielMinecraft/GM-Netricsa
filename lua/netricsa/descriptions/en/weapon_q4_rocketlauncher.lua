ROCKET LAUNCHER


WEAPON: Rocket Launcher
AMMO:   Rockets
ROF:    ~40 rounds/min


DESCRIPTION:

The Rocket Launcher in fires powerful rockets that detonate upon impact or after a set time, dealing area damage. Rockets generate strong blast impulses that can knock back enemies and destroy weak structures. Ideal choice for area clearing and dealing with clustered enemies.

NOTES:

- Explosions deliver heavy splash damage and can harm the shooter if fired too close.
- Great for crowd control and encounters, but less effective against agile small enemies.
- Ammo conservation and precise shots are crucial â€” misses are costly.
