DESCRIPTION:

The Legionnaire is like Rome's off-brand sentry-armed with a spear and the unwavering belief that billing your enemy with pointy sticks solves everything. Clad in a green tunic and sandaled boots, he lumbers forward, almost mechanically. His charge-up time rivals snails on a coffee break-making him less a threat and more comedic relief... until heâ€™s teamed up with tougher Romans, then he's suddenly less laughable and more shovel-to-the-face material.

TIPS:

- A leisurely stroll and one punch usually sends him flying.
