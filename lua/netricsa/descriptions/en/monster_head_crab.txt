DESCRIPTION:

Common Headcrabs are the classic Xen parasites known for permanently attaching themselves to a host's head. Unlike the Earth variant, which may leap off and roam independently, the Common Headcrab burrows into the skull and remains bonded for life (or until killed), turning the host into a Common Headcrab Zombie or Runner Headcrab Zombie, eventually evolving into a Gonome.

The fusion is horrifying: the host's skull is visible beneath the alien carapace, and the creature's control is absolute. Once attached, the Headcrab dictates movement, aggression, and behavior, making the host a slow, relentless predator.

TIPS:

- Avoid being bitten - once attached, removal is nearly impossible without killing the host.
- Firearms or explosives are effective against the host and parasite simultaneously.
- Keep an eye on groups; swarms of Common Headcrabs can quickly overwhelm intruders.
