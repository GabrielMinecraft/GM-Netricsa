LUMES


Lumes are a species of monstrous creatures that dwell in the depths of terraformed planets-especially on LOEK III and around Elysion One Station. They are covered in a nearly black carapace that reflects faint light, seemingly absorbing all life around them. Most of them emit a faint red-orange glow-their weak point.

Their bodies have evolved to survive in dangerous environments: acids, radiation, extreme temperatures-all of these are not barriers for Lumes, but rather a natural element. They crawl, scratch, and attack in groups or alone, ready to breach security barriers, swarming through the corridors, tunnels, and infrastructure of inhabited worlds.
