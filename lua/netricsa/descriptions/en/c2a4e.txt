BLACK MESA, LOCKED EXIT


So, some "good news" from one of the surviving guard: apparently there is an exit to the surface just above us. Sunlight, fresh air, no more conveyor presses-that sort of thing. Sounds great, right? Well, naturally, there's a catch.

The doors are sealed with high-level clearance. Only Black Mesa scientists have the codes, which means we can't just kick the door down and waltz out. We'll need to track them down if we want to see the sky again.

Now for the bad news - H.E.C.U. forces are already crawling through this sector. Theyâ€™re not here to save anyone. They've got orders to clean up, and in case you haven't noticed, we are part of the mess.

So, here's the plan:

Step one: find the scientists with the clearance.

Step two: get the exit codes.

Step three: get out before the soldiers decide we look better as target practice.

Oh, and one last note-don't trust the guard's optimism too much. "Just above us" in Black Mesa terms could still mean half a mile of deathtraps, alien infestations, and probably another locked door. But hey, that's what makes life exciting, right?
