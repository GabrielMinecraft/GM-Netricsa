DESCRIPTION:

Dog is a massive, loyal robot built by Eli Vance and continually upgraded by his daughter Alyx. Originally intended as a mechanical "pet" and bodyguard, Dog has grown into a towering powerhouse of strength and resilience. Despite his intimidating frame, he shares a playful, almost childlike personality-he enjoys games of fetch, tossing around huge objects with ease.

In combat, however, Dog transforms into a wrecking machine: tearing apart Combine forces, tossing cars as projectiles, or smashing through fortified barriers. His unique blend of brute force and engineered precision makes him indispensable to the Resistance.

Dog's loyalty to Alyx is absolute. He protects her at all costs, often charging into impossible situations with unstoppable momentum.

TIPS:

- Dog can lift and throw objects heavier than any human-use his strength to clear paths.
- Resistant to most small-arms fire; best to let him draw enemy fire.
- When Dog goes on a rampage, stay clear-friend or foe, his momentum can crush anything in his path.
