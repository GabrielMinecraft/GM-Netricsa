DESCRIPTION:

Also known as "Caped Baldy", Saitama is a ridiculously overpowered hero who happened to be running past and casually decided to help Germany in its conflicts. To most, he looks like an ordinary bald man in a yellow suit with a white cape - but in truth, he is capable of defeating any opponent with a single punch.

Unlike other fighters, Saitama has no real strategy, no training regimen (other than 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10 km run every day), and no fear. His battles often end instantly, leaving allies and enemies equally confused.

Though invincible, his biggest weakness is his boredom - he rarely takes anything seriously, and only truly enjoys a fight when he meets an opponent who seems (at least briefly) challenging.

TIPS:

- Don't expect a duel - the fight will end in one punch.
- If he's on your side, congratulations, you already won.
- His greatest enemy is mosquito freak.
