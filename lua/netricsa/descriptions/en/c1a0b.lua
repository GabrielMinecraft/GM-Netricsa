BLACK MESA, CONTROL ROOM


Sam, you have reached the main control room of the Anomalous Materials test chamber. A group of scientists is already waiting for you here. According to intercepted dialogue, they are finalizing calibration protocols and insist that "everything is within acceptable parameters." From their tone, however, it is obvious that no one fully understands what they are about to trigger.

These researchers are expecting you - or rather, Freeman - to carry out the final phase of the experiment. They are discussing energy levels, stabilization fields, and the insertion of a sample into the reactor core. In other words: they are on the edge of tearing reality apart, and they want you to push the button.

Sam, I strongly advise caution. If this is connected to Mental's manipulations, the consequences may be catastrophic. Still, playing along remains the most effective way to gather information. Just... try not to "accidentally" blow anything up before we know exactly what kind of forces they are about to unleash.
