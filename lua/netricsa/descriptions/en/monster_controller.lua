DESCRIPTION:

The Alien Controller is a floating psionic overseer from Xen, acting as the enforcer of the Nihilanth's will. While its own energy attacks are dangerous, its true power lies in remote domination: Controllers can subjugate Vortigaunts, forcing them into battle against their will. This is why Vortigaunts appear hostile within Xen despite their natural reluctance to fight - the Controllers act as psychic wardens, keeping the enslaved race in line.

They drift through the air with eerie grace, pelting intruders with crackling psionic orbs while commanding troops below.

TIPS:

- Target Controllers quickly - once destroyed, nearby Vortigaunts may break free.
- Their energy bolts curve in flight - keep moving.
- Precision fire or explosives can down them fast.
