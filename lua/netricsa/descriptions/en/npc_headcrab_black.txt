DESCRIPTION:

Another horrific mutation from Xen, poison headcrabs are distinguished by their bloated black bodies. Their fangs deliver a venom that nearly kills the victim instantly, reducing them to a sliver of life. The poison slowly fades, but rarely before other enemies finish the job. These creatures often accompany poison zombies, clinging to their host until thrown into combat like living weapons.

TIPS:

- Their venom is the deadliest of all headcrab types.
- Engage at range-don't risk close combat.
