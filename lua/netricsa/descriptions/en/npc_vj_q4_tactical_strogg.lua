DESCRIPTION:

Tactical Strogg are Stroggified human marines chosen for exceptional battlefield prowess, tactical intelligence, and ruthless efficiency. They not only have heavy cybernetic augmentations (armor plating, mechanical limbs, neural implants) but also retain much of their human fighting intuition. 

They operate in squads, use cover, flank opponents, and coordinate their attacks. Unlike most Strogg units, they use human weapons rather than built-in weapons. 

TIPS:

- Prioritize eliminating Squad members with Railguns or Hyperblasters; they deliver massive damage at range.
- Use grenades or explosives to disrupt their formations.
