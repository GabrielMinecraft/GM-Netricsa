DESCRIPTION:

The Vortigaunts were once a free, intelligent race, but under the rule of the Nihilanth they became enslaved shock troops of the Xen invasion. Driven by psionic chains, they were forced to fight humans despite their reluctance. Vortigaunts channel bio-electric energy through their hands, unleashing destructive bolts of green lightning. In Black Mesa they were as feared as any alien attacker, but their strange chants and mournful voices hinted at something deeper: a people fighting against their will.

TIPS:

- Keep cover between you and their lightning.
- Close the distance quickly-they are weaker in melee.
- Don't underestimate groups; they coordinate well.
