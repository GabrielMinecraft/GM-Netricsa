DESCRIPTION:

The M2A3 Bradley is a versatile armored fighting vehicle deployed by H.E.C.U. forces. Its primary armament is a high-caliber machine gun, capable of suppressing infantry effectively. Additionally, the Bradley is equipped with a rocket launcher for dealing with vehicles, structures, or concentrated enemy forces.

A unique feature of the Bradley is its rear troop deployment hatch: it can carry squads of marines or Black Ops personnel and deploy them directly into combat zones, creating multi-layered threats. Its combination of firepower, mobility, and troop transport makes it both a frontline assault vehicle and a force multiplier.

TIPS:

- Take cover to avoid both machine gun fire and rockets.
- Destroying the Bradley quickly prevents troop deployment.
- Flanking or explosives are essential to damage the armored chassis.
- Watch for infantry emerging from the rear hatch - even if the vehicle is destroyed, deployed troops remain dangerous.
