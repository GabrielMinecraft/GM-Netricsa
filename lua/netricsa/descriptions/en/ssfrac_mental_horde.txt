THE MENTAL'S HORDE


The Mental's Horde (also known as the Empire of Ta-Um or the Enemies of Osiris) is a ruthless army of countless alien races united by the will of their overlord, Mental, the last of the ancient Hum-Tah race. The Horde's goal is the complete annihilation of all sentient life in the universe that does not serve their god.

Mental gathers his legions from slaves, mercenaries, mutants, and creatures created through magic and technology. He subjugates entire civilizations, promising power or forcibly turning them into his unwilling servants. Some see him as a deity, others as the bane of the galaxy, but without exception, all either serve him or perish.

The Mental Horde knows no tactics or mercy—its strength lies in its boundless numbers and fanatical obedience. Under its onslaught, empires have fallen, nations have vanished, and stars have been extinguished. When Mental awakens, a new cycle of genocide begins, and worlds are reduced to dust one after another.

Mental uses both technology and dark magic: he creates cyborgs, revives the dead, controls portals, and commands entire armies of monsters—from arachnoids and reptilians to headless soldiers and demons.

Where Mental's Horde passes, nothing remains-only silence and ruins.
