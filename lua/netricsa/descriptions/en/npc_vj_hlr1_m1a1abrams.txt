DESCRIPTION:

The M1A1 Abrams is a heavily armed tank deployed by H.E.C.U. forces, modified to deliver devastating rocket barrages instead. Its reinforced armor protects against most small arms and light explosives, while rockets can destroy vehicles, structures, and infantry clusters alike. Its slow but deliberate advance allows it to control key areas, flatten obstacles, and dominate ground combat.

TIPS:

- Always keep cover; rockets have wide blast radius and can hit from a distance.
- Use high-explosive or armor-piercing weapons to damage it.
- Flanking maneuvers are essential - frontal assaults are near-suicidal.
- Avoid open terrain where the tank can freely fire rockets.
