DESCRIPTION:

Developed by Japanese scientists of Shaidzu-Gandi, the Armored Heavy-Tech Robot was engineered as a tool of planetary annihilation. Unlike standard invader units, this war machine is built with reinforced armor plating.

In ranged combat, it unleashes devastating laser beams from its eyes, capable of cutting through vehicles, buildings, and defensive positions. When closing in, it uses a razor-sharp blade arm, slicing enemies in half with mechanical precision. Its dual offensive design makes it one of the deadliest invader constructs fielded against Earth.

TIPS:

- Stay out of direct line of sight-eye lasers are highly accurate.
- Never allow it into melee range-the blade arm is instantly fatal.
