BLACK MESA, FLOODED ROOM


Sam, this section of the office complex has been completely flooded. Someone thought it was a good idea to leave automated turrets online in these conditions. Conclusion: they're firing at anything that so much as ripples the water. Including you.

Now for the strange part: sensors confirm the presence of a single human figure on a raised platform overlooking the flood. Male, business suit, briefcase. He's just... watching. Not interfering, not helping. Just standing there, observing the chaos like it's a boardroom presentation. His identity is unknown, but his behavior suggests he knows exactly what's happening.
