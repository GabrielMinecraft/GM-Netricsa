XEN, GONARCH'S LAIR (PART 2)


Alright - you made it through the first mess. The cave opens up again, bigger and smellier, and that rotten queen isn't done yet.

The immediate plan is simple: push into the next chamber, finish the Gonarch off, and stop any more of those little parasites from hatching. Expect acid pools, falling rock, and a second wind of spawns when she gets angry. Keep moving; standing still is a bad idea.
