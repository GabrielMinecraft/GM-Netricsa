DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Soldier Engineer is a specialized transhuman unit tasked with battlefield fortification and technological warfare. Distinguished by his orange visor lenses, he carries advanced Combine weaponry, most notably the Reager Rifle - a prototype electrical weapon capable of stunning and electrocuting targets in rapid succession.

Beyond his offensive role, the Engineer can deploy automated Overwatch turrets, instantly establishing kill-zones and reinforcing Combine positions. These soldiers are often assigned to strategic choke points, defensive nests, and Nova Prospekt-style prison fortresses, where their skills are most effective.

The Engineer is less common than regular infantry but far more dangerous, especially when entrenched with automated defenses. Resistance forces consider him a priority target, as eliminating Engineers disrupts Combine defensive lines and weakens their technological advantage.

TIPS:

- Destroy turrets quickly after deployment before they overwhelm you.
- The Reager Rifle is deadly at mid-range - use long-range weapons to neutralize them.
- Orange visor glow is the easiest way to identify them.
