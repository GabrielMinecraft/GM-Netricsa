DESCRIPTION:

The Biter is the green variant of the same Xen species as the Archer. Unlike its red relative, it lacks ranged abilities and relies entirely on biting. Biters are swift underwater and will attempt to swarm their prey, overwhelming with numbers rather than spitting acid.

TIPS:

- Keep them at bay with ranged weapons - they can't attack from a distance.
- Shotguns or rapid-fire weapons are effective if they close in.
- Easier to dispatch than Archers, but dangerous if ignored in groups.
