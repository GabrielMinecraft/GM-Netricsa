DESCRIPTION:

The Overwatch Soldiers, also known simply as Combine Soldiers, are the enforcers of the Combine's rule on Earth. Once human, they have been surgically altered and cybernetically enhanced to serve as transhuman infantry. Their bodies are modified for endurance and discipline, while their minds are conditioned for unwavering loyalty to the Combine Overwatch.

They wear dark tactical armor with respirators that distort their voices into mechanical tones, giving them an inhuman presence on the battlefield. Highly organized and tactically proficient, Overwatch Soldiers coordinate assaults with precision, often calling in support from manhacks, scanners, or heavier units.

Ruthless and relentless, they are deployed wherever resistance to Combine authority arises, crushing opposition with overwhelming firepower.

TIPS:

- Expect ambush tactics and coordinated fire - don't get flanked.
- Explosives are highly effective against their squads.
- Headshots can bypass their body armor.
