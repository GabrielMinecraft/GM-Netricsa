DESCRIPTION:

The Mental Institution is a gargantuan pyramid-shaped mobile fortress, serving as the lair of the antagonist, Mental. Armed to the teeth with cannons, fireball and rocket launchers, and equipped with instant-death wheels, it's a mechanized behemoth designed solely to pulverize intruders.


BEHAVIOR & ATTACK PATTERNS

Waves of Fatso Fighters: Crashes, causing high damage.

Fireball Barrages: Scattered explosive projectiles from the pyramid.

Seagull Fighter Waves: Bomb-laden planes that are tough to dodge.

Cannonball Blasts: Heavy physical projectiles.

Missile Salvoes: Overwhelming missile bursts.

Spinning Wheels: Once the core is exposed, the wheels advance - contact means instant death. 


TIPS: 

- Phase One: Clear enemy waves to trigger the fortress activation.
- Phase Two: During cannonball and firewave phases, evade and target the exposed core. If you're armed with Serious Damage, this stage severely punishes the fortress. 
- Key Strategy: Neutralize Fatso Fighters first-they're the biggest threat. Seagull Fighters are secondary; once core is open, focus on rapid heavy damage.
