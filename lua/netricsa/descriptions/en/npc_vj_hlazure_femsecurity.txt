DESCRIPTION:

The Female Security Guard is part of Black Mesa's security team, tasked with protecting researchers, equipment, and sensitive areas of the facility. While similar in training and equipment to male security personnel, she often patrols corridors, labs, and maintenance areas that require flexibility and quick response.

During the Resonance Cascade, female security guards displayed adaptability and teamwork, helping to evacuate scientists, defend critical locations, and coordinate with other personnel. Though not heavily armored, they are trained to engage hostile Xen creatures and intruders, making them valuable in early containment and defense operations.

TIPS:

- Protect them when possible - they can assist with escort missions.
- They are vulnerable to heavy attacks, so keeping them out of direct fire is crucial.
- Observe their patrol patterns; they may indicate key points or safe routes.
