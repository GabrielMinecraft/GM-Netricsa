BLACK MESA, PART WITH SEWERAGE


Sam, anomalous energy spikes are going crazy here! Multiple teleport signatures detected: houndeyes, headcrab-zombies, and enough noise to wake up half of Xen. The whole area is unstable.

To move forward, you'll need to get into the sewer system. But here's the trick: the valve down there isn't for drainage - it's for flooding. Once you turn it, the water level rises, and only then you'll be able to swim through a higher exit shaft. Efficient design, don't you think? Humans really love their overcomplicated solutions.

And the cherry on top - my sensors spotted him again. Business suit, briefcase, calm as a rock in a hurricane. Just standing there, like the chaos doesn't even exist. 

So: you're outnumbered, knee-deep in sewage, about to deliberately flood yourself to escape... and under surveillance by the most suspicious office worker in the multiverse. No pressure!
