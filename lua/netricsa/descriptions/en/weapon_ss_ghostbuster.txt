DESCRIPTION:

An even more experimental branch of the original XL2 Lasergun research, this incredibly rare weapon fires a deadly continuous beam that cuts through everything. Only used by a select few highly trained EDF soldiers for secret field testing, the weapon quickly got the nickname "Ghostbuster", due to its similar nature as a beam weapon from a certain movie.
Using the same power cells as the XL2 Lasergun, this weapon was originally designed to be a replacement to the bulky and heavy Minigun, however as it never entered mass production, most soldiers believed this "super weapon" is just the stuff of legends.

NOTES:

- Use it to quicky cut through masses of medium sized enemies.
