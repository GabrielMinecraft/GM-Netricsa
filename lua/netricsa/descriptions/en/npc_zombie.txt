DESCRIPTION:

These unfortunate creatures were once human, until a headcrab latched onto their skulls and took complete control of their nervous system. Their twisted bodies stagger forward with jerky, unnatural movements, driven only by the parasite's hunger. The host's mind is still dimly conscious within, forced to watch helplessly as the headcrab uses their body as a puppet. Their distorted moans and screams are the last remnants of the human trapped inside.

TIPS:

- Aim for the headcrab to quickly neutralize the host.
- Keep your distance-they lunge without warning.
