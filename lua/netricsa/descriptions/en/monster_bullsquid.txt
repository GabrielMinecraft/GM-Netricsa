DESCRIPTION:

The Bullsquid is a feral predator from Xen, notorious for its unpredictable aggression. With a muscular build and tentacle-like jaws, it attacks anything that enters its territory-humans, aliens, or even its own kind. It uses ranged toxic spit to soften prey before closing in with claws and a devastating tail swipe. On Earth, they were a constant danger in the Black Mesa Research Facility, stalking water channels and tunnels. Their relentless hostility and bizarre screeching make them one of the most feared free-roaming Xen predators.

TIPS:

- Don't underestimate their ranged spit-it's both painful and disorienting.
- Circle-strafe to avoid the tail swipe.
- Use explosives or rapid fire to bring them down before they close in.
