BLACK MESA,  BACK AGAIN


Sam, I'm detecting that we've looped back toward the Anomalous Materials sector. But don't expect it to look the same. The corridor ahead has collapsed into chaos - sparks are flying, fire is spreading along broken pipes, and the once-sterile walls of Black Mesa are now blackened and torn apart.

The cascade hit this place especially hard. Structural scans show multiple breaches in containment chambers, with dimensional energy saturating the air. In simple words - the whole sector is toxic with instability.

Warning: from the main entrance I'm picking up human voice patterns. A scientist is still alive - screaming, panicked. But my probability matrix tells me his survival chances are slim. If you go there, you'll likely encounter both collapsing structures and hostile lifeforms.

Strategic note: this sector originally housed the experimental equipment that triggered the cascade. If anything still functions, it could hold valuable data... or unleash another disaster.

Recommendation: proceed with caution. Rescue, if possible - but don't risk the mission. Remember, you're still being mistaken for someone called Freeman. The locals might see you as their only hope, whether you like it or not.
