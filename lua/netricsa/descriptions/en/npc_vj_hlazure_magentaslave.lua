DESCRIPTION:

Magenta Slaves are warped variants of Vortigaunts. These beings are former Black Mesa scientists fused with Xen entities, resulting in a striking magenta hue for their skin and gear-magenta collars and armbands replace the typical green.

Their origin involves a disturbing experiment: a scientist fused with a Chumtoad inside a water tube, birthing the first Magenta Slave. This fusion process was repeated to create more, allowing them to proliferate throughout Black Mesa and become progressively aggressive psionic attackers.

TIPS:

- Engage from cover: Their energy blasts are psionic, fast, and hard-hitting.
- Isolate and eliminate: Groups are incredibly dangerous-swift isolation is key.
- Use environmental hazards: Force packs into traps or bottlenecks to diminish their threat.
