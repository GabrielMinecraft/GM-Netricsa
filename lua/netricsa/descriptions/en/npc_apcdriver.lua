PERCEPTION: Vehicle systems interface
SIZE:       ~1.5 ft (sphere)
ENDURANCE:  Low (fragile outside APC)
HOSTILITY:  Medium (only through vehicle)
WEAPONS:    None directly; controls mounted APC cannons + rockets
REWARD:     250 FC
THREAT:     Medium-High (when in APC)

DESCRIPTION:

The Combine APC Driver is a specialized spherical drone, visually similar to a Combine  rollermine, that functions as an autopilot system for Armored Personnel Carriers when no human or transhuman pilot is available. Once connected, the sphere integrates itself into the APCâ€™s systems, granting the vehicle autonomous control of its weaponry and movement.

Alone, the Driver is nearly harmless-fragile and unable to attack. Inside an APC, however, it becomes a dangerous extension of Combine power, controlling heavy cannons, mounted machine guns, and rocket launchers with machine precision. When destroyed or ejected, the APC ceases functioning and becomes immobile.

TIPS:

- Focus on destroying the APC itself; the Driver won't leave unless forced.
- High explosives can disable the Driver faster than direct gunfire.
- If caught outside of its vehicle, it can be neutralized with minimal effort.
- Don't underestimate a Driver-controlled APC-they never miss.
