DESCRIPTION:

Leeches are small, worm-like Xen predators, essentially living suction cups with teeth. They lurk in pools of Xen liquid, waiting for unsuspecting prey to come near. Once attached, they latch on with horrifying strength and start draining energy - a literal living leech.

Despite their size, Leech swarms can immobilize larger creatures by sheer numbers, making them surprisingly dangerous. Their gelatinous, slippery bodies and wriggling movements make them hard to hit, and their sudden attacks are a nightmare for explorers who step too close to Xen's aquatic environments.

TIPS:

- Keep distance; melee is risky.
- Avoid standing in Xen water or slimy surfaces where Leeches hide.
- Explosives or heavy fire can disperse swarms quickly.
