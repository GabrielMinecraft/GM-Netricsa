DESCRIPTION:

Nihilanth was the supreme ruler of Xen, a majestic psionic being, powered by Combine technology and enslaved. Once, he served as a lieutenant of the mysterious Mental, carrying out his commands with loyalty. Eventually, Nihilanth declared himself independent, igniting a bitter feud between factions. Forced to flee, he was captured by the Combine, who tortured, experimented on, and perverted his mind and body. Miraculously, Nihilanth managed to orchestrate a rebellion and escape, fleeing to Xen, where he established his dominion.

With immense telepathic powers, he commanded armies of Vortigaunts and headcrabs during the Resonance Cascade, leading an invasion of Earth from a border world. His grotesque, childlike body floated in cavernous chambers, protected by impenetrable energy shields and countless minions. Despite his power, the Nihilanth's body bore the marks of torment and limitation: cybernetic implants, the scars of slavery, and a broken mind.

TIPS:

- Destroy the crystalline spheres powering his shield before engaging in combat.
- Beware of teleportation traps - stay mobile.
- Powerful explosives are the most effective way to end a battle.
- Destroy the crystal in his head.
