DESCRIPTION:

Known in MMO chronicles as the "Old Goat", this prehistoric mutant was accidentally spawned inside a giant toilet in a medieval RPG world. Players originally thought it was just an Easter egg, until it turned out the creature could wipe out a full 40-man raid in seconds.

It looks like a classic T-Rex and its fighting style mixes dinosaur fury. 

TIPS:

If you see it on the toilet - run.
