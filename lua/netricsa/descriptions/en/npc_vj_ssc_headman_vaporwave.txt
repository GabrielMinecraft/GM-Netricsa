DESCRIPTION:

An executed Sirian soldier, raised from the dead by Mental and remote controlled by Life Control Unit (LCU). 
A Vaporwave carries his own head in one hand to receive audio/visual information. A highly experimental variant of the Firecracker, the Vaporwave carries a unique weapon system that fires a full circle of various magical projectiles around itself, trying to flood the surrounding area with hurt. To be able to withstand the weight of this weaponry, its skin was alloyed with a sort of bio-metal, making it a bit more tough than its regular brethren.

TIPS:

- Can attack in all directions at once.
- Has multiple attack options which appears to be chosen without consideration.
