DESCRIPTION:

The Human Grunt is a soldier of the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (H.E.C.U.), deployed to Black Mesa during the resonance cascade. Officially sent to "contain the situation", in reality they were ordered to eliminate both the alien threat and any surviving witnesses ( Aliens, Scientists, Guards, Delta Sector Special Forces and Everyone).

These soldiers are well-armed, disciplined, and work in coordinated squads. They use cover effectively, throw grenades to flush out enemies, and will flank if given the chance. Their radios crackle with chatter, adding to the sense of a well-organized military operation. Despite being only human, they are one of the deadliest foes in the entire incident due to sheer training and equipment.

TIPS:

- Never underestimate their grenades - they love lobbing them around corners.
- Break their squad cohesion; lone Grunts are much easier to handle.
- Use ambushes, tripmines, or explosives to counter their superior numbers.
