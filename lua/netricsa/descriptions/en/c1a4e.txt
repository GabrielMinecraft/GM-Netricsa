BLACK MESA, VENTILATION SHAFT


Sam, you've reached the base of a massive ventilation system. This isn't your average desk fan-it's an industrial turbine designed to clear reactor fumes. Right now, it's silent, locked down by the power surge. To move forward, you'll need it spinning at full throttle.

The catch: the only way up to the next sector is through the ventilation shaft directly above the fan. Without airflow, you can't reach it. With airflow... well, you'll be launched like a human cannonball into the ducts.

Recommendation: restore auxiliary power, engage the fan, and time your jump. Don't hesitate-one mistake and you're either minced by the blades or left behind in the silo maze. On the bright side, once you're airborne, you'll be well on your way toward the Fuel and Power sectors.
