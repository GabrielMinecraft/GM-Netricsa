DESCRIPTION:

The Control Sphere is a mysterious biomechanical entity believed to act as a  unit for Xen forces. Its spherical body floats effortlessly, radiating pulses of alien energy. These pulses disrupt the minds of lesser Xen creatures, bending them to its will, while also interfering with human neural activity. When threatened, the Control Sphere unleashes powerful bursts of concentrated energy, capable of shredding armor and electronics alike. Few have seen it without a host of Xen minions nearby, suggesting its primary role is to guide and command rather than to fight directly.

TIPS:

- Expect it to be surrounded by other Xen creatures under its influence.
- Its energy bolts travel quickly; cover is essential.
- Disrupting or destroying it can weaken the coordination of nearby Xen forces.
