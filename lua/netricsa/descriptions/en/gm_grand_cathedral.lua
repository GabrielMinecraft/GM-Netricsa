THE GRAND CATHEDRAL

Uhhhhh, that was a long, hard walk. For a second I thought we were finished when those three thousand monsters ambushed us in the mountains, but I calmed myself down remembering that we have each other, and they were all alone!

But listen to this: while we were heading here, I re-analyzed all the info we gathered so far and found out some really interesting stuff. 

Arc-Al-Magis are our allies, they are the keepers of the Holy Grail, the only ones who were in constant contact with the Sirians. It seems that Mental somehow found their village, but they managed to hide the Grail before they were attacked. I checked all the historical records with keywords "Al-Magi" and found out that the only church that Magis ever built was "The Church of Sacred Blood", located somewhere in Eastern Europe. With a little help of my navigational sensors and telemetry, I found the exact location of the church. And with a little help of your charming red sneakers we came here, hopefully in time, to prevent Mental from getting its.... uhm... hands, tentacles, claws (!?)... whatever on the Holy Grail. 

But... (yes, there is always a but) to get to the church, one must pass through the "Corridor of Death". And beats me if I know what that is!
