FLAT GRASS


Flat grass is one of the oldest and most iconic location.  It provides exactly what the name promises: a massive, flat field of grass, surrounded by an endless blue skybox.

There are  no anomalies. Players use Flatgrass to spawn contraptions, test weapons, drive vehicles, or just cause large-scale chaos without restrictions.

The location's most distinctive features are:

Infinite-feeling space: a huge flat surface, ideal for large builds and physics tests.

Minimal architecture: only a single spawn building with a one hidden room and a rooftop for observation.
