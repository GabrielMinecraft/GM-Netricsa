DESCRIPTION:

Known by the name ArchPsion of Xen, the Kingpin is one of the most terrifying psionic warlords of Xen. Its grotesque form - a massive exposed brain with four eyestalks and a worm-like tail for locomotion â€” is a living engine of psychic domination and elemental destruction.

The creature is constantly surrounded by a psionic shield, making direct attacks nearly useless until its energy is disrupted. It hurls searing orange plasma bolts and summons arcs of lightning capable of reducing flesh and stone alike to cinders.

What makes the ArchPsion even more dangerous is its ability to summon hordes of Xenian beasts to fight by its side. Among these are unique variants of Bullsquids, each mutated for elemental combat:

Devilsquid - Fire-based, spits incendiary projectiles that ignite everything.

Frostsquid - Ice-based, sprays freezing liquid that immobilizes enemies.

Poisonsquid - Violet, secretes venomous acid that corrodes armor and poisons flesh.

Toxicsquid - Green, spreads corrosive bile clouds that linger and choke.

Hybridsquid - White, agile, spits long-range white plasma bolts at high speed.

Standard Bullsquid - Classic predator, aggressive and numerous.

Legends among Xen creatures describe the Kingpin as a "living nexus" of psionic storms - a commander that embodies both control and destruction.

TIPS:

- Focus fire on disrupting its psionic shield before dealing real damage.
- Stay mobile to avoid its lightning strikes and mind control pulses.
- Prepare for waves of summoned creatures - crowd control is vital.
- Fire and toxin-resistant gear is highly recommended.
