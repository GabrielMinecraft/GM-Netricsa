DESCRIPTION:

The Combine City Scanner is a hovering surveillance drone deployed throughout urban centers under Combine control. Equipped with a powerful camera eye and tactical uplink, Scanners patrol the skies above streets, courtyards, and restricted zones, constantly photographing civilians and forwarding data to Combine command.

While not heavily armed, Scanners play a vital role in maintaining control over occupied cities. Their flash unit blinds and disorients targets, making it easier for ground units to capture or eliminate enemies.

TIPS:

- Easy to destroy with small-arms fire - but expect Combine reinforcements after.
- Their flash attack can leave you vulnerable - look away when they charge it.
- They have low armor - even melee strikes can take them down.
