DISPLACER CANNON XV11382


WEAPON:      Displacer Cannon (Project XV11382)
AMMO:        Dimensional energy cells
ROF:         ~1 shot/3 sec

DESCRIPTION:

Experimental teleportation weapon developed by Black Mesa before the incident at the facility. Fires concentrated energy blasts that can displace living and non-living targets across short distances. Alternate fire mode teleports the user to a random location, allowing tactical repositioning or escape. Considered highly unstable but extremely versatile.

NOTES:

- Primary fire: teleports targets on impact, causing high damage.
- Alternate fire: teleports the user to a random point on the map.
- Extremely powerful but risky; misuse can harm the user.
- Limited availability; project remained experimental.
- Uses a mini-uranium reactor as energy source, similar to Tau Cannon or Gluon Gun.
