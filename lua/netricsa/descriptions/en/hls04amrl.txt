BLACK MESA, ARRIVAL OF H.E.C.U.


Sam, new signatures detected: Human Expeditionary Combat Unit-codename H.E.C.U. On paper, they're an elite rescue team deployed to contain the disaster and assist survivors. In practice... let's just say their definition of "containment" usually includes shooting anything that moves, including the survivors.

Initial civilian reports indicate excitement-scientists actually thought help had arrived. Poor fools. Within minutes, that "help" opened fire on both Xen intruders and the research staff. Effective? Yes. Friendly? Not even close.

Now the office complex is a three-way battlefield: Xen creatures pouring through unstable portals, Mental's troops staking territory, and H.E.C.U. Marines sweeping through with orders to erase witnesses. You're just the cherry on top of this interdimensional sundae.

Recommendation: Don't wait for a rescue. If it wears camouflage and carries a rifle, it's not your friend. Use their firepower to your advantage-let them fight the aliens and Mental's forces first. Then step in and mop up the survivors.
