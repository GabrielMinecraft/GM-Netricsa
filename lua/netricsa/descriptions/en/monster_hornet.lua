HORNET FROM XEN


CLASS:      Xen Projectile Organism
METABOLISM: Insectoid alien (hive-grown)
PERCEPTION: Heat-seeking instinct, simple target-lock
SIZE:       ~1 ft (30 cm)
ENDURANCE:  Very low (fragile, easily destroyed mid-flight)
HOSTILITY:  High (mindlessly attacks nearest target)
WEAPONS:    Piercing sting (biological dart)
REWARD:     5 FC
THREAT:     Low (individually), High (in swarms)

DESCRIPTION:

Hornets are living, hive-bred alien projectiles fired by Alien Grunts from their organic arm cannons. Once launched, they buzz rapidly toward their target, adjusting course with heat-seeking precision. Though individually weak, their persistence and swarming nature make them deadly in large numbers.

Hornets dissolve after impact or if destroyed mid-flight, leaving no recoverable material. Their existence reflects the bio-engineered warfare of Xen - turning even ammunition into a living weapon.

TIPS:

- Keep moving - Hornets track stationary targets easily.
- Shoot them mid-flight to reduce swarm damage.
- Use explosives or heavy fire to thin groups of Alien Grunts before they release too many Hornets.
- They don't have a needle or a red dress.
