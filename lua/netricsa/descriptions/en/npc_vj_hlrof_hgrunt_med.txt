DESCRIPTION:

The H.E.C.U. Medic is a field-deployed marine trained to keep his unit alive during prolonged operations. While not as heavily armed as frontline grunts, Medics carry medical kits and combat stimulants, allowing them to restore wounded soldiers and keep the squad fighting at full strength.

On the battlefield, they balance aggression with support - firing with SMGs or pistols, then darting behind cover to patch up their comrades. Their role makes them a force multiplier: a squad with a Medic can endure significantly more punishment than a regular patrol.

TIPS:

- Focus fire on Medics first - their healing can prolong battles.
- Explosives or heavy ordnance are ideal to take out both Medics and their patients at once.
- Isolated Medics are less threatening, but never ignore one in a group.
