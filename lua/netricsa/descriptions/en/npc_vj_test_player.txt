DESCRIPTION:

The Player NPC, also known as the Mimic Player, is a highly unusual NPC that replicates all actions of the player. Whether jumping, shooting, or using items, this NPC mirrors the player's movements and interactions in real-time.

It is designed as a sandbox experiment or gameplay challenge, creating unpredictable and often chaotic scenarios. In combat, the Mimic Player can become a deadly threat if it replicates the playerâ€™s offensive actions, effectively turning your own skills against you.

TIPS:

- Observe its behavior to anticipate its next move-it mirrors all your inputs.
- Can be used for puzzle-solving or experimental gameplay scenarios.
- If armed, it will use weapons as effectively as the player.
- Avoid provoking it unnecessarily-aggression is copied and escalates quickly.
