DESCRIPTION:

Developed by the scientists of Lord Anton, the Plasma Grenade is an experimental weapon powered by a self-contained electrical core. Upon detonation, it releases a violent plasma discharge that not only shocks and immobilizes enemies for a short time but also causes devastating energy burns.

Unstable and unpredictable, this weapon is considered too dangerous to be mass-issued, as even mishandling during arming could lead to accidental discharge. Only trusted units of Anton's forces are permitted to wield such technology - its effects on organic and mechanical targets alike make it one of the most feared devices on the battlefield.

NOTES:

- Temporarily paralyzes enemies caught in its blast radius.
- Do NOT let it fall into enemy hands.
- Effective against both infantry and light robotics.
