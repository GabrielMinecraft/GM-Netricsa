DESCRIPTION:

The Earth Bullsquid is a terrestrial offshoot of the Xen predator that adapted to Earthâ€™s ecosystems after the Resonance Cascade. This subspecies is bulkier, with a thick, fatty frame giving it a bloated appearance. Its hide is a dark red tone, making it stand out from the greenish Xen originals.

Bigger than its true Xen relatives, the Earth Bullsquid makes up for its size with brute mass and aggression. Its corrosive bile is stronger and burns longer on contact, making it a serious hazard in urban ruins and industrial zones. Despite its sluggish appearance, it can lunge with frightening speed, using its weight to overwhelm prey.

TIPS:

- It's fat body absorbs damage well-don't underestimate its endurance.
- More dangerous up close-avoid letting it charge.
- Explosives remain the most reliable way to bring it down.
