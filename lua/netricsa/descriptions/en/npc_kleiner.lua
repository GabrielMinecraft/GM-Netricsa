DESCRIPTION:

Dr. Isaac Kleiner is one of the last surviving Black Mesa scientists and a cornerstone of the Resistance's scientific efforts. An eccentric but brilliant physicist, Kleiner dedicates himself to developing teleportation technology and repurposing Combine machinery for the benefit of humanity. His greatest contribution is his laboratory in City 17, which serves as a vital hub for Resistance operations.

Kleiner is absent-minded and often scatterbrained, prone to rambling about theories or becoming sidetracked by his pet headcrab, Lamarr, whom he affectionately keeps despite her tendency to cause chaos. Despite his clumsiness, Kleiner's mind is razor sharp, and his inventions play a crucial role in giving the Resistance a technological edge.

Though physically fragile and unsuited for combat, Kleiner's courage lies in his unwavering determination to resist the Combine with intellect rather than brute force. His mentorship of Gordon Freeman reflects both his admiration for Gordon's skills and his reliance on him to enact the Resistance's boldest plans.

TIPS:

- Protect Kleiner at all costs-his inventions are the backbone of Resistance tech.
- Don't let Lamarr roam free; chaos tends to follow.
- Though harmless, his eccentricities are vital to morale in dark times.
- Doesn't want to post memes on the Discord server, so he's in the nuthouse.
