BLACK MESA, UPLINK


Sam, access to the Lambda Complex remains sealed. The scientists inside are alive, but they can't risk opening the reactor doors until outside authorities are alerted. Standard procedure demands a signal be transmitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC), confirming the Black Mesa crisis.

The problem? The uplink array was damaged during bombardment. The antenna has to be realigned manually. Of course, the entire communications sector is under heavy assault: artillery strikes above, H.E.C.U. units entrenched within, and reports of Mentalâ€™s forces bleeding through unstable portals.

You won't be alone, though. A surviving scientist and a security guard are attempting to reach Lambda as well. They want out, but until that signal goes through, the reactor doors stay locked. They're counting on you or rather, "Freeman" - to reset the uplink.
