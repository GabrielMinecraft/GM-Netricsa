DESCRIPTION:

This grotesque creature is the result of a human host overtaken not by one, but several headcrabs-specifically the poisonous variety. Their bloated, rotting frame staggers slowly but is nearly impossible to ignore. The parasite drives the body into a frenzy, tearing off and hurling poisonous headcrabs at enemies. The host's flesh hangs loosely from its bones, making it appear more corpse than man. Every groan it utters is a chilling reminder of what once lived inside.

TIPS:

- Stay far away-the poison headcrabs can cripple you instantly.
- Target the headcrabs clinging to its body for an easier kill.
