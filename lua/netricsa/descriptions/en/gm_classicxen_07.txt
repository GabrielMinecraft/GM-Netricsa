XEN, THE RED PORTAL


Darkness. That's all you see at first - an endless void broken only by scattered floating islands of alien stone. Each one barely large enough to stand on. And on the largest of them: a glowing red portal, pulsing like an open wound. From its depths echo screams and fragmented voices of scientists, distorted as if played backwards.

This is the last stretch. The jumps between islands are long, the footing unstable, and Mental’s forces are lurking in the dark. Sensors confirm they're capable of intercepting you mid-jump - snatch squads waiting in the void, hoping you slip just once.

"I am the last... I am the last..." - Nihilanth.

Whether it's a warning, a plea, or a threat, it’s impossible to tell.

Recommendation: time your jumps perfectly, keep weapons ready, and don’t look down. The red portal isn't just the next step - it's the point of no return. Once you enter, there's no more running.
