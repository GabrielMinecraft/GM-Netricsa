XEN, NIHILANTH'S LAIR


He greeted you with a name that wasn't yours - "FREEMAN". Unforgivable, really. And then, his voice hammered directly into your head:

"He will deceive youâ€¦ deceive you".
"You will never know the truth".
"Are you alone?"
"Now die... now die."

Not exactly motivational speeches.

Objective:

Destroy the Xenium crystals that feed the massive shard lodged in his skull. Only when those supports are broken will his shield falter.

Nihilanth begin teleporting you across his domains. Survive the journey through these warped fragments of Xen, and push onward to the exit.

He says you'll never know the truth. Fine - we'll just kill him without it.

Those crystals? Think of them as his Wi-Fi. Cut the connection.

When he screams "Now die", don't take it personally. He says that to everyone.
