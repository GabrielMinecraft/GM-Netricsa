DESCRIPTION:

Unlike the agile, acrobatic female assassins, the male Black Ops operatives are heavier, more armored, and specialize in ranged engagements. They operate in organized squads, often providing sniper overwatch or close-quarters ambushes with silenced SMGs.

They are part of the Black Ops team sent to completely erase evidence of the Black Mesa incident, including wiping out H.E.C.U. survivors. Their black uniforms and masks give them an ominous, faceless look - soldiers of secrecy, answering only to the highest orders of the U.S. government.

Deadly accurate and relentless, they represent the next step in escalation once the standard H.E.C.U. fails. Facing them means you've officially become a "loose end."

TIPS:

- Keep moving and use cover; standing still is suicide.
