DESCRIPTION:

Pit Drones are vicious assault creatures bred by Race X as shock troops. With reptilian features, hooked claws, and bony ridges lining their skulls, they are designed for both melee brutality and ranged lethality. Their signature ability is launching sharp bone-like spikes from their foreheads, capable of piercing armor and flesh at mid-range. In close combat, they slash relentlessly with talons, often overwhelming lightly armed soldiers.

Despite their ferocity, Pit Drones are not heavily armored, relying on sheer speed and aggression to kill prey. They are deployed in swarms, making them particularly dangerous in confined spaces where evasion is limited. On Earth, they were first encountered during the Black Mesa incident, often hunting in packs alongside Shock Troopers.

TIPS:

- Keep moving-standing still makes you an easy target for their head spikes.
- Use SHOTGUN or MP5 to quickly cut them down before they get close.
- Grenades or explosives are effective against groups.
- Don't let them flank you-they work best in numbers.
