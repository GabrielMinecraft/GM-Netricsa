BIO-MECHANOID, SPAWNER


CLASS:      Bio-Mechanoid, Spawner
METABOLISM: endothermous cyborg
PERCEPTION: genetically programmed
SIZE:       20 ft standing
ENDURANCE:  medium
HOSTILITY:  high
WEAPONS:    marsh-hopper nests
REWARD:     4500 FC
THREAT:     high

DESCRIPTION:

A biological mechanism grown in Mental's bio-tanks. Its genome is programmed to give it biologically grown mechanical parts and side slots where cybernetically enhanced marsh-hopper nests are attached and directly connected to its nervous system.
Adjusted to attack without thinking. It is speculated that its nests are spatial-dimensionally linked to the largest marsh-hopper spawning ground in the galaxy, so it is able to release endless amounts of marsh-hoppers, until destroyed.

TIPS:

- If not eliminated quickly it will soon swarm the entire place with marsh-hoppers.
- When killed, it will release a larger amount of marsh-hoppers on death, so watch out.
