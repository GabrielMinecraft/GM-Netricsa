BLACK MESA, FREEZER STORAGE


Sam, you've just stepped into the freezer wing of Black Mesa's cafeteria complex. Normally, this place is used to keep supplies cold-today, it's doubling as a morgue and a battlefield. The temperature may be below zero, but the fight between Mental's squads and Xen creatures is heating things up fast.

Enemies lurk between hanging slabs of meat.

Environmental hazard: the refrigeration units are unstable.This which can disorient both you and your enemies. On the bright side, anything you kill here stays fresh indefinitely.

Recommendation: keep moving, don't linger, and remember-slippery floors are just as deadly as enemy fire. If you manage to survive, maybe you can grab a frozen snack for the road. Just... maybe not the one still moving.
