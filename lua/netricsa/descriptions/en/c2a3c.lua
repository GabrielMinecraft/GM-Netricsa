BLACK MESA, FREEZER GENERATOR



Sam, you've stumbled into another sector of the generator complex - this time, rows of industrial freezer chambers, their doors frosted shut, air so cold it burns your lungs. Ð¡ondensation clings to every surface.

Thermal scans confirm two hostile forces locked in combat:

Xen fauna - vortigaunts and headcrabs.

Mental's horde - Zorgs and beheadeds, forcing their way through the opposite corridor.

The result? A frozen battlefield where you are caught right in the crossfire. Ammo casings skitter across ice, alien lightning arcs between steel beams.

Recommendation: let them thin each other's numbers, then strike when both sides are bleeding. Cold slows reaction time - use it to your advantage. And Sam? Try not to get freezer-burned.
