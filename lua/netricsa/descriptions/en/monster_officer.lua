DESCRIPTION:

Barney is the quintessential Black Mesa security guard - a loyal, gun-toting human who knows the halls better than anyone. Equipped with a pistol, sometimes a shotgun, and a stubborn sense of duty, he patrols corridors and tries to keep the facility from descending into total chaos.

Friendly to the player, Barney can fight off aliens, saving scientists in distress. His skill set is surprisingly versatile, though he is still human and will panic if a tentacle or Gargantua shows up. He has an uncanny ability to appear just in time to save the player from a hail of Hornets or a rogue Alien Grunt.

TIPS:

- Stick close to Barney; he can help in firefights.
- Don't rely on him as a tank - he's brave, but human.
- Listen to their screams carefully - they might indicate nearby danger.
