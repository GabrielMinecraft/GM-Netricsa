BLACK MESA, SILO INTERIOR


Sam, you've reached the heart of the cistern. And by "heart", I mean a cavernous shaft where three Tentacle-class organisms are happily redecorating the place with scientists. Their one core are buried deep in the machinery, wrapped around catwalks, ladders, and control consoles. This isn't a battle. You can't outgun them. This is a puzzle, and the solution involves fire.

The bad news: the control for the reactor furnace is split across multiple sub-sectors. The Black Mesa's engineers to implement a three-stage safety lockout. Translation-you'll need to leave the silo, restore auxiliary power, open fuel flow, and finally engage ignition. Only then will the reactor deliver enough heat to reduce these oversized spaghetti monsters to barbecue.

The good news: tentacles can't climb ladders. The bad news: they don't need to. Their strikes reach halfway up the chamber, and they're hypersensitive to sound. Every gunshot, every footstep, even a sneeze could get you skewered.

Recommendation: move quietly, plan your detours carefully, and remember-the only way to win this fight is not to fight at all. Once the reactor roars back to life, you'll have the biggest flamethrower on Earth at your disposal. Until then... silence is survival.
