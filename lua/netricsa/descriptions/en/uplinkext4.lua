BLACK MESA, UPLINK FINALE


Sam, the signal has been sent and the reactor doors are now open. The Lambda Complex is waiting.

But before you celebrate-there's one last problem. A surviving scientist warns us that a Gargantua has been sighted roaming the halls. It's tearing through security like paper, and he strongly suggests you avoid direct contact unless you enjoy becoming serious barbecue.

Adding to the strangeness, that mysterious man with the briefcase has once again been spotted, this time calmly standing beside a guard, watching the chaos unfold as if it were a stage play.

Your next step is simple: get to the elevator, ride it down, and make your escape. At least, that's the plan.
