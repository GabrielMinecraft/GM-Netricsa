BLACK MESA, BEFORE THE INCIDENT


Teleportation ends... but not where you expected. No ruined Xen, no aftermath. Instead, you stand in Black Mesa before the catastrophe. The labs are intact, scientists are calm, and everything smells like bad coffee and ozone.

And once again, they mistake you for Freeman. I'd complain, but apparently, in every timeline, people love that name. Somewhere else in this sprawling facility, another "Sam that's you but not you" is preparing to activate the Anti-Mass Spectrometer. We both know how that turns out.

Meanwhile, you're dragged into a different project. The researchers here whisper about a parallel test - a prototype portal, independent from the main experiment. They want you to oversee it while the Spectrometer hums to life in another wing.

Two experiments. Two disasters, waiting to collide. One is history. The other... is about to be written.

On the bright side, this means you'll get blamed for only half the apocalypse. Progress!
