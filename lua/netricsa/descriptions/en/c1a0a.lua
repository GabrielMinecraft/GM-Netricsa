BLACK MESA, LAST CORRIDOR


Sam, you are now moving through the final access corridor leading to the Anti-Mass Spectrometer chamber. This entire section is under strict security, but thanks to the Freeman misidentification, doors are opening automatically for you. Convenient, but unsettling.

According to the data I intercepted, the Spectrometer is designed to analyze exotic crystalline materials under extremely high energy. In reality, what they are attempting borders on interdimensional physics - something far beyond what this facility can safely control.

The scientists here seem nervous, but strangely determined. They keep reminding "you" to hurry and prepare for the insertion procedure. Apparently, they expect Freeman to be the one operating inside the chamber itself. Translation: they're planning to put you directly in the line of fire.

Recommendation: keep your cool and keep observing. Whatever is about to happen in that chamber is not a simple experiment - it's the beginning of something much larger.
