DESCRIPTION:

Harvesters are gigantic, 50-foot tall spider-like robot mechs used by the Strogg as anti-vehicle heavy armor. They are the largest, most powerful Strogg units seen. The Harvester consists of a humanoid "torso" (equipped with two blaster arms) attached to four spider-like legs.  They are extremely resilient and very dangerous. They attack primarily with a full-auto blaster, and can periodically launch a swarm of two or three powerful homing rockets. They can also impale enemies and even vehicles with their legs; this attack is an instant kill even against a hovertank. 

TIPS:

- The Harvester will use the large "tube" to fire the guided missiles, disable the tube can prevent further launches.
- A better way to destroy a Harvester is shooting it's legs. Although it is difficult to shoot it down, two destroyed legs will instantly kill a Harvester.
- While on foot, its possible to avoid the Harvesters; unless you have enough firepower, don't waste ammo on it.
