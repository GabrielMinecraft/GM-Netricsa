DESCRIPTION:

The Scientist is a Strogg unit tasked with medical research and the Stroggification process. Its lower body is replaced by a hover-pad, allowing it to float silently through medical labs. The torso is human, but with a respirator over the mouth and bright orange glowing eyes. Around its body are grafted sharp tools - a saw for a right hand, mechanical limbs holding needles - used originally for experimentation, but pressed into service when attacked. 

When cornered, the Scientist will lob a poison gas grenade, which explodes and releases a toxic cloud that damages over time and bypasses armor. Its melee attacks with saw and needles are brutal at close range. It often sneaks around corners or floats above to surprise intruders in the Strogg Medical Facilities. 


TIPS:

- Keep distance - its melee tools are deadly close-up.
- Avoid poison clouds; they disorient and bypass armor.
- Use ranged/automatic weapons to dispatch it quickly.
- Be alert for hovering movement; the hover-pad makes it harder to detect by sound.
