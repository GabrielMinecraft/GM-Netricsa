DESCRIPTION:

Snark Nest is the fully matured stage of the common Xen snark. Unlike its small, hyperactive offspring, the adult moves slowly on four insect-like legs, dragging its heavy body across the ground. Its skin takes on a sickly green tone, while its back swells with clusters of glowing red eggs - the next generation of snarks waiting to hatch. Upon death, the eggs on its back can rupture, releasing new larvae of snark

TIPS:

- Eggs on its back make it easier to spot, but don't underestimate the danger.
