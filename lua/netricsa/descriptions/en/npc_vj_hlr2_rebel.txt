DESCRIPTION:

Rebel Soldiers are members of the human Resistance, organized to fight the Combine occupation. They are ordinary humans trained quickly to wield firearms and coordinate attacks, often improvising tactics in urban and rural combat zones.

They operate in squads, cover civilians, secure supply routes, and provide critical support to main operatives like Gordon Freeman or Alyx Vance. Though less advanced than Combine forces, their adaptability, morale, and sheer numbers make them formidable opponents.

Rebels rely on teamwork and hit-and-run tactics rather than brute force. Their resilience comes from commitment to humanity's survival rather than superior weaponry, and they are often seen coordinating with vehicles such as the Merkava Tank or assisting scientists and medics in the field.

TIPS:

- Protect them-they are most effective in groups.
- Supply them with ammo and medkits to maintain frontline pressure.
- Use them to scout areas and ambush Combine patrols.
- Rebel squads can overwhelm even lightly armored Combine units if coordinated.
