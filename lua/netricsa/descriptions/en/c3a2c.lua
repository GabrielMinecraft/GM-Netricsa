BLACK MESA REACTOR CORE, THE PORTALS


The reactor hall is no longer an engine - it's a rift. Portals blossom like malignant tumors, crackling arcs of energy weaving. The scientists you need to reach are just beyond, but the direct paths are gone; only the unstable portals connect this sector to theirs.

And here's the problem: step into the wrong one, and you'll be spat out into a radiation vent, a collapsing shaft, or worse - nothing at all. The telemetry analysis points to a safe combination: 2 → 1 → 7. Follow that sequence and you'll thread the maze clean.

Points of interest:

Portal instability. Wait too long and you'll lose your chance - or worse, land somewhere random.

The Observer. Standing near one of the active portals is the man in the business suit. Always silent, always watching. He doesn't interfere, doesn't react to threats, but his presence near is no accident. It's either a warning... or a confirmation.
