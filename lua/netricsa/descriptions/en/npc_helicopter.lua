DESCRIPTION:

The Hunter-Chopper is a formidable Combine rotorcraft used to deliver heavy fire support, patrol zones, and hunt high-value targets like refugees or Resistance units. Manned by two Overwatch soldiers (pilot & gunner), it combines human design and Combine tech to create an aerial predator.

It has a front pulse cannon for direct fire, wings fitted with missiles, and it can drop timed bombs and mines below. It is equipped with powerful sensors and tracking systems (including infrared) to follow enemies through cover. Its cockpit, made of bulletproof and opaque glass, shields the crew, making it hard to target directly.

TIPS:

- Small arms fire is mostly useless until you have heavier weapons or position.
- Always keep moving; staying in open will get you hit by its pulse cannon or bombs.
- Watch for its bomb/mine drops — they’re deadly, especially under vehicles or in tight passages.
- Use cover or elevation to dodge its line of fire.
- If possible, hit it from below or from cover when the cockpit is vulnerable.
