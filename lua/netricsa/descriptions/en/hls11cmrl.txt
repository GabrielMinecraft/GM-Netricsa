BLACK MESA, ROCKET PROBLEM


Congratulations, you made it inside. And in true Black Mesa tradition, "inside" means worse.

Front and center: a missile. Not a display model, not a rusty shell - a fully-fueled, armed-to-the-teeth delivery system, humming with enough destructive potential to erase the entire facility (and anyone dumb enough to stand nearby). The problem? The whole launch bay is wired like a paranoid Christmas tree. Mines, tripwires, pressure triggers - if a rat sneezes too hard, the rocket goes boom, and with it the rest of Black Mesa.

Here's the kicker: if one of Mental's portals manifests inside this chamber - say, at the warhead's beam housing - the destabilization would trigger a sympathetic detonation. Translation: one careless spawn, and weâ€™ll all be remembered as a short-lived fireworks show.

Your way forward is straight down. A cargo elevator at the center descends to the lower maintenance decks, where the bypass routes are located. But don't get comfortable - the ride itdown will likely be ambushed. Between Xen stragglers, Mental's pets, and the ever-present risk of an accidental explosion, the shaft is less "elevator" and more "moving coffin."

Threat summary:

Rocket chamber: entire room is a trigger zone, avoid explosives at all costs.
