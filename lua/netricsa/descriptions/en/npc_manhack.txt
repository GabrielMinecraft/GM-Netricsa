DESCRIPTION:

The Manhack is a sinister piece of Combine technology - a small, hovering drone armed with razor-sharp buzzsaw blades designed for urban suppression and pursuit of fugitives. Its agility allows it to zip through narrow streets, ventilation shafts, and even shattered windows, turning entire city blocks into kill zones.

What most citizens do not realize is that Manhacks are not piloted by soldiers - instead, they are remotely controlled by civilians. The Combine disguise the control system as harmless arcade machines, where citizens believe they are playing a video game for entertainment, earning "points" by hunting virtual rebels. In truth, every movement and every kill is real, and the drones they control are slaughtering actual people in the streets.

This cruel deception not only keeps the population distracted but also ensures the Combine maintains a fresh supply of “operators” without risking their own forces. To the average civilian, it’s just a game - but to the hunted, it’s death by a thousand cuts.

TIPS:

- Manhacks are fragile - a few bullets or a strong melee strike will destroy them.
- Their saws are lethal at close range - keep distance.
