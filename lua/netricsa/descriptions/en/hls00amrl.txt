BLACK MESA, TRAIN - PART 1


Sam, I've been analyzing the situation and... things are complicated.

After the destruction of Mental's fortress on Sirius, we should've been safely en route to Earth. Instead, you suddenly appeared inside a massive underground research facility known as Black Mesa. I cannot confirm whether this is the result of Mental's interference, a temporal anomaly, or just your questionable navigation skills.

Currently, you're being transported deeper into the complex by means of a high-security tram system. Black Mesa appears to be a secretive organization involved in experimental physics and weapons research. Their scientists don't look like a real threat - though, judging by the military presence, the same can't be said about their security forces.

I strongly advise caution. The atmosphere here is unstable, both literally and figuratively. Whatever brought you here, it wasn't by accident. I suspect this place holds some connection to Mental's broader plans - and we need to find out what it is.

For now: sit tight, enjoy the ride... and try not to shoot anyone yet.
