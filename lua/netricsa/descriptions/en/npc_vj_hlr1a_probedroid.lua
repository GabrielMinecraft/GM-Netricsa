DESCRIPTION:

Developed by Black Mesa as a multipurpose support drone, the Probe Droid is a hovering machine designed to aid combat units in the field. Its primary function is to scan for allied lifeforms and repair or stabilize them using a directed healing beam. However, its programming also includes offensive protocols: when hostiles are detected, the droid launches sharp, toxin-coated darts that can pierce light armor. Upon destruction, its unstable power core detonates, sending out a violent explosion - turning the loss of one droid into a final attack against enemies.

TIPS:

- Keep your distance - the self-destruct blast is deadly in close quarters.
