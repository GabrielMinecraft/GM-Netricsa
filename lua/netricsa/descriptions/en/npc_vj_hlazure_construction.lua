DESCRIPTION:

The Construction Workers are civilian contractors employed at Black Mesa for facility repairs, structural maintenance, and expansion of underground complexes. Recognizable by their orange vests, hard hats, and work tools, they are non-combatants caught in the chaos of the Resonance Cascade.
Though untrained for combat, their practical knowledge of Black Mesa's infrastructure makes them surprisingly valuable allies. They can navigate restricted maintenance tunnels, unlock sealed areas, and occasionally lend improvised assistance with tools. However, their lack of armor and combat experience leaves them highly vulnerable to both Xen creatures and hostile military units.
Some eyewitness reports suggest that, despite their civilian status, a few workers defended scientists and security staff with construction gear, standing their ground until evacuation was impossible.
