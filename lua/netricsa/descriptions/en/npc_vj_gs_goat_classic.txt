DESCRIPTION:

The Classic Goat from Goatville may look like a simple farm goat, but appearances are deceiving. This is, without a doubt, the most reckless goat in existence.

Unlike its "normal" variants, the Classic Goat is the original - the chaos-bringer that started it all. Every bug, glitch, and ragdoll moment feels amplified when this goat is involved.

TIPS:

- Don't ever leave it alone near anything fragile.
- Headbutts can send objects (and people) flying like missiles.
- This goat is physics itself - wild, broken, and unstoppable.
