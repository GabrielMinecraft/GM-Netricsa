DESCRIPTION:

The Mini Turret is a compact variant of the standard Black Mesa Armored Turret. It retains automated targeting capabilities and rapid-fire functionality but is smaller, lighter, and more maneuverable. Like its full-size counterpart, it can be mounted on floors or ceilings, allowing for versatile deployment in tight spaces.

While less armored than the full-sized version, it remains deadly against unprotected targets, capable of suppressing intruders and defending critical access points. Its small size makes it harder to spot until it opens fire.

TIPS:

- Explosives or precise gunfire can disable it quickly.
- Check above and below - even small turrets can cover unexpected angles.
- Avoid standing in corridors or chokepoints where it can target you efficiently.
- Use environmental cover to minimize exposure to its machine gun fire.
