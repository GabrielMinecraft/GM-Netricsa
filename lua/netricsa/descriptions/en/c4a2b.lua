XEN, GONARCH'S LAIR (FINAL PART)


This is it - the final chamber. The Gonarch is cornered, enraged, and stronger than ever. Acid sprays, collapsing platforms, endless headcrab spawn - she'll throw everything she has left at you.

Once she falls, don't celebrate too soon. The ground here isn't stable. You'll need to destroy the floor beneath you - that's where the hidden portal is, leading into even deeper layers of Xen.

Objective is clear:

Defeat the Gonarch once and for all.

Collapse the chamber floor.

Enter the portal and prepare for the descent into Xen's core.

Nihilanth's presence grows stronger the deeper you go. Whatever comes next, he's waiting.
