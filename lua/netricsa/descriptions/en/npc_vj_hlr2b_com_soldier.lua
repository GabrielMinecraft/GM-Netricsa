DESCRIPTION:

The Beta Overwatch Soldier represents an early stage in the Combine's attempt to create a reliable transhuman army. Unlike the finalized Overwatch units seen later, these prototypes retained more human features and used bulkier, less advanced equipment. Their armor is patchwork, offering moderate protection, and their cybernetic augmentation is crude compared to the later generations.

Despite being less disciplined and more fragile than modern Overwatch Soldiers, the Beta units were deployed in great numbers during the early phases of Combine occupation. They relied on sheer aggression and numbers rather than precise tactics, often rushing opponents with outdated weaponry and poor coordination.

Their existence foreshadowed the ruthless refinement of Combine transhuman design - the flawed predecessors that paved the way for the perfected Elite forces.

TIPS:

- Weaker armor than finalized Combine units - aim center mass.
- Less accurate at long range but deadly in close combat.
