DESCRIPTION:

The Baby Voltigore is the juvenile stage of the feared Voltigore. Though smaller and less armored, it is still a deadly predator, bred to serve as both a hunter and a pack fighter. Baby Voltigores display surprising agility, pouncing on prey and slashing with sharp claws. Unlike their adult counterparts, their plasma discharges are weaker, but still capable of incapacitating unarmored targets.

They often move in small groups, using their speed and ferocity to overwhelm isolated enemies. As they mature, their chitin hardens and their electrical organs develop into the devastating artillery of the full-grown Voltigore. Encountering a Baby Voltigore is often a grim warning-an adult may not be far behind.

TIPS:

- Don't underestimate them-Baby Voltigores can easily swarm lone targets.
- Their plasma attacks are weaker but still dangerous; keep moving to avoid being hit.
- Shotguns and SMGs are effective against them before they close distance.
- Be cautious-groups of Baby Voltigores often act as a vanguard for an approaching adult.
