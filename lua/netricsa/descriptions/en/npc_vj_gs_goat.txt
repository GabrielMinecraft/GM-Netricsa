DESCRIPTION:

The Crazy Goat is the a physics-defying goat that turns any environment into pure chaos. It charges headfirst into cars, objects, and people, sending them flying with impossible force. Despite being just a goat, its ability to ragdoll at will, lick and drag objects, and survive explosions makes it a walking (and bleating) catastrophe.

TIPS:

- Don't underestimate the headbutt; it can launch even heavy objects.
- If it ragdolls - it's not dead, just messing with physics.
- Chaos follows wherever it goes; avoid standing near fragile objects.
