DESCRIPTION:

The Gladiator is a heavily armored Strogg combatant built for both ranged suppression and brutal close quarters. Seen often in fortified compounds, and elite patrols, the Gladiator combines firepower and defense. They also possess a visible, circular energy shield mounted on their arm, which completely repels all energy fired at them (including explosive damage from direct-impact missiles). The shield is large enough to cover most of a Gladiator's body, though their head, shoulders, and shins are still partially exposed. Gladiators raise their shield immediately after taking damage and lower it only immediately before a Railgun shot, after which they raise it again.

TIPS:

- The Gladiator only raises his shield after taking a hit, so the first shot almost always hits and deals damage. If the shield is down, this provides a good opportunity to hit the Gladiator with a rocket or spray from the Nailgun. The Lightning Pistol can be used to suppress the shield generators and briefly disable them, opening the door for attacks. Furthermore, the shoulder-mounted railgun is always vulnerable, so it can be shot at for damage.
