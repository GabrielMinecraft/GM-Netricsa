DESCRIPTION

The Failed Transfer Zombie Torso is the remains of a Strogg conversion gone horribly wrong. Despite their mutilation, they remain alive - crawling using their arms and dragging their exposed viscera across the ground.

Even without legs, they're fast in short bursts, capable of surprising lunges.

TIPS:

- Stay mobile - they crawl quickly and can lunge from cover.
- Aim for the head or upper chest to stop movement instantly.
- Listen for dragging sounds to detect them before they see you.
