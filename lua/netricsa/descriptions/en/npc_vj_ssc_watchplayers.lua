DESCRIPTION:

When Mental conducted experiments to enhance Gnaar vision by giving them piercing blue eye, something went terribly wrong. The mutation spiraled out of control - their entire bodies were absorbed into their own expanding eye, leaving behind floating, fleshy orb filled with rage and hunger.

Fascinated by the grotesque results, Mental approved the creation of a new division: the Gnaareyes - bio-levitating organisms trained for aerial combat. They drift eerily through the air, guided entirely by vision-based instincts, and attack by consuming victims with their enormous pupils.

They cannot walk or crawl like their former kin, but their flight and all-seeing gaze make them unpredictable and terrifying opponents.

TIPS:

- Keep distance and use ranged weapons.
- When close, they may "consume" targets instantly.
