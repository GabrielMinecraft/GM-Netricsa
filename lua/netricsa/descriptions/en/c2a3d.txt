BLACK MESA, BLACK OPS SIGHTED


Sam, I need your full attention here. We've been tracking multiple heat signatures moving with inhuman precision - silent, fast, deliberate. Identification confirmed: Black Ops female assassins.

Unlike H.E.C.U. they specialize in stealth, ambush, and close-range elimination. Standard armor: lightweight, optimized for agility rather than protection. Standard arsenal: silenced pistols, SMGs. Standard tactic: strike from the shadows, disappear before you can aim.

Warning: they don't fight like soldiers, Sam. They fight like predators. Reports show enhanced acrobatics - flips, wall jumps, impossible dodges. Your usual run-and-gun approach? Expect it to fail. You'll need to watch sound cues, muzzle flashes, and shadows to track them.

Recommendation: keep moving, force them into the open, and don't underestimate them. These aren't Mental's mindless brutes or Xen's and Race X wild creatures. These are professionals trained to erase problems like you.

Oh, and one more thing: their mission it's to erase witnesses. Which means every scientist, every guard, every grunt H.E.C.U.... and you.
