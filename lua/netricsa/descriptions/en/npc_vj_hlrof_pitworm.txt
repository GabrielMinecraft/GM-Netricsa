DESCRIPTION:

The Pit Worm is a monstrous Race X creature that serves as a guardian within Black Mesa's underground Waste Processing Area. Emerging from the Toxic Disposal Basin, it resembles a segmented arthropod, dominated by a single, massive eye and a maw filled with twelve teeth. Its eye unleashes a searing energy beam-its primary attack-while powerful claws defend against close threats. 

Traditional weapons prove ineffective. When its eye is hit, it momentarily recoils and defends itself with a claw shield before retaliating. It also reacts violently to intrusions through adjacent passages, swiping aggressively at them.

TIPS:

- Conventional weapons are ineffective-focus on triggering the environmental kill sequence.
- First, activate the steam vent and valve via the control panels scattered around the chamber.
- Use the emergency gearbox override to divert toxic waste into the basin.
- Once the toxic sludge floods the area, the Pit Worm is finally defeated-then the bridge behind it provides your path forward.
