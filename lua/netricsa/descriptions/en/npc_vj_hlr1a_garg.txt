DESCRIPTION:

The Four-legged Gargantua is a divergent subspecies, a brute engineered for sheer physical dominance rather than incendiary destruction. Its towering body is clad in a thick, rock-like carapace streaked with glowing yellow stripes, a sign of hardened tissue growth unique to this variant.

Unlike its more infamous counterpart, the Four-legged Gargantua lacks fire-venting claws - instead, it relies on bone-crushing bites, devastating ground slams, and relentless melee force. This makes it less spectacular at range, but far deadlier in close combat, as no armor or barricade can withstand its crushing blows.

Scientists speculate this subspecies was an earlier, alternative design of the Gargantua, optimized for raw survivability over ranged firepower. While less versatile, its durability and shockwave attacks make it no less terrifying.

TIPS:

- Keep distance - this variant is deadliest up close.
- Its bite attack can instantly kill unarmored targets.
- Shockwave ground strikes can bypass cover - avoid its line of approach.
- Heavy explosives or concentrated fire are required to pierce its reinforced armor.
