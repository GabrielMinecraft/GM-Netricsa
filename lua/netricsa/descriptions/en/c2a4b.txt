BLACK MESA, FLESH CONVEYOR


What you"re seeing here isn't production - it's disposal. The factory floor is dominated by an endless conveyor system, moving heaps of human remains like raw material. Burned uniforms, twisted helmets, and shattered tools still cling to the bodies. Some are scientists, others security, many unrecognizable.

Telemetry notes high accident frequency in this sector even before the resonance cascade. Workers vanished, reports went missing, and yet the machines never stopped. Now the belts grind on, indifferent, carrying the dead toward furnaces or chemical vats.

Hazards: slick platforms stained with blood and oil, moving gears that can crush anything caught between them, and unstable catwalks shaking with every rotation. Headcrabs scuttle freely among the remains, feeding without resistance.

Recommendation: stay mobile on the belts, avoid the crushing presses, and do not fall into the waste stream. Whatever "process" this plant once served, itâ€™s now just a monument to human error and expendability.
