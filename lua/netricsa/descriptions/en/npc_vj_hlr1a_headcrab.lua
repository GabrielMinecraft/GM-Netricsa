DESCRIPTION:

The Alpha Headcrab is a terrifying evolution of the standard parasite. Larger, bulkier, and blood-red in color, it commands fear with its raw power. Unlike its smaller cousins, the Alpha's bite is instantly lethal to an unprotected human - a single strike is enough to kill outright. It still retains the classic ambush tactics of its species, leaping from shadows or ceilings, but its speed and size make evasion far more difficult. In Xen, these mutants act as apex parasites, and on Earth, they are one of the most feared biohazards.

TIPS

- Never let it get close - its bite is instantly fatal.
- Keep your distance and use high-damage weapons.
- Expect ambushes from ceilings, vents, and shadows.
