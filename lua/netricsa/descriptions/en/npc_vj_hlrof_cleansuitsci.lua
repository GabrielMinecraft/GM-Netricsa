DESCRIPTION:

The Clean Suit Scientists are a specialized branch of Black Mesa research staff assigned to hazardous environments. Outfitted with full-body protective suits, they are primarily deployed in areas with biological, chemical, or radiological dangers, where normal lab attire would mean certain death. Their helmets are sealed, with limited breathing systems to filter contaminated air.
These scientists were often found working on sensitive projects in restricted zones, maintaining equipment, or handling volatile materials. When the Resonance Cascade struck, their suits gave them a slight survival advantage against toxins and Xen spores, though they remained just as vulnerable to physical threats.
Despite their professional training, they are not combatants - their survival instinct is to flee and seek shelter, leaving combat roles to security and H.E.C.U. forces. Their knowledge, however, is invaluable: many have access to clearance codes, containment systems, and weapon development labs hidden deep within the facility.

TIPS:

- Protect them if possible - they often have useful information.
- Don't expect them to fight; avoid using them as shields.
- Listen to their screams carefully - they might indicate nearby danger.
