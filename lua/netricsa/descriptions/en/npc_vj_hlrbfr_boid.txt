DESCRIPTION:

The Green Boid is a rare subspecies of the familiar Xen Boid, first documented aboard the UH-1 research vessel. Сolored with vibrant green luminescence, they glide through confined spaces in synchronized flocks. Like their Xen cousins, they are entirely harmless, serving as living spectacles rather than predators.

Researchers believe their glow may be a form of communication or group cohesion, allowing them to form tighter aerial patterns even in darkness. Despite their alien appearance, they remain curious, docile creatures with no aggression toward humans or other beings.

TIPS:

- Do not harm them—they pose no threat.
- Watch their flocking patterns for clues about nearby environmental hazards.
