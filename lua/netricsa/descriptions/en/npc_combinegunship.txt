DESCRIPTION:

The Gunship is a flying assault synth deployed by the Combine. It resembles a strange hybrid of organic and mechanical design, with a rounded body, two flipper-like wings near the front, a large rotor “tail”, and mechanical components (exposed tubes, glowing parts) that betray its synthetic nature. 

It patrols skies over critical Combine territories (Citadel, Nova Prospekt, key outposts), raining down accurate pulse cannon fire and occasionally heavier belly cannon blasts (though the belly cannon is mostly unused except in special commands). Highly maneuverable, capable of 180° turns in flight, it avoids close distance engagements and fights from range, using its speed and agility to stay above threats. 

TIPS:

- Use explosive weapons (RPG, grenades) rather than small arms — it is mostly impervious to bullets. 
- Keep moving and use cover. Gunships prefer long-range attacks and height advantage.
- Pay attention to its warning sound before it starts firing - gives you a brief chance to hide. 
- Avoid exposing yourself in open areas, especially under flight paths.
- Try to attack from blind spots (below, behind, or sides) to reduce exposure to its gun.
