SPECIAL FORCES OF SECTOR DELTA 


Special Forces Of Sector Delta are an elite unit of the Delta Sector, under the direct supervision of the mysterious man with the suitcase. They operate where official structures fail, carrying out missions that no one is supposed to know about. Their existence is hidden behind a multitude of false protocols and classified archives, and their missions are aimed at maintaining an invisible balance between worlds.

These fighters appear at the most dangerous moments - on the brink of catastrophes and portal breaches. When Black Ops enter the zone, Special Forces are already working deeper: extracting technology, eliminating targets, and altering the course of events. Cooperation with Black Ops does not make them equal â€“ meaning they serve the state, while Special Forces serve only the man with the suitcase.

Equipped with experimental weaponry and armor that suppresses sound and light, they move silently and quickly.
