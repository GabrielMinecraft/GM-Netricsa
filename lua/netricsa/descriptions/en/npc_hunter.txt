DESCRIPTION:

Hunters are lethal mid-sized Synths designed by the Combine as anti-infantry and anti-vehicle units. Often deployed in packs alongside Striders, they serve as skirmishers, sweeping urban ruins and hunting Resistance fighters with brutal efficiency.

Though smaller than Striders, Hunters are terrifyingly fast and agile, able to leap over obstacles, ram enemies into walls, and tear through cover. Their signature weapon is the flechette launcher, firing glowing darts that explode after impact. At close range, they use their bladed forelimbs to slash and skewer prey.

Hunters display pack tactics, communicating with eerie howls and shrieks, coordinating charges, and flanking enemies. They are relentless and fearless, pursuing targets until either destroyed or victorious. Resistance veterans consider them among the most dangerous Combine units short of a Strider and Crab Synth.

TIPS:

- Keep moving - Hunters excel at cornering stationary targets.
- Their flechettes stick briefly before exploding - use this moment to dodge.
- Aim for the head/eye cluster for maximum damage.
- Use heavy firepower (RPGs, shotguns, or explosives, AR2 Ball) - small arms are less effective.
