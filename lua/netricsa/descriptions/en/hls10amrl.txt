BLACK MESA, THE XEN WARRIOR CAPSULE


Phew... getting out of that crushing factory felt like crawling out of a meat grinder. And just when I thought the day couldn't surprise us anymore, guess what? It did.

While analyzing the sector we just entered, I picked up something unusual-something way bigger than headcrabs or even vortigaunts. Turns out we've just stumbled onto the first confirmed sighting of a Xen Warrior. Not your average alien grunt, no sir. This guy is the real deal, a decorated frontline commander from the Xen side (and a deserter). He's locked in a containment cell, guarded, studied... but very much alive.

Historical data cross-check: Alien Grunts are considered the backbone of interdimensional shock troops. Stronger, smarter, and with enough firepower to take on entire squads. They were never supposed to show up this early in the conflict. Which makes his presence here... well, let's just say "concerning."

Now here's the interesting part: telemetry suggests he's just standing there. Watching. Almost like he's waiting for something-or someone. And between us, I don't like that look.

So, to recap:

We escaped death-by-conveyor.

We're greeted by houndeyes.

And oh yeah, we've just met the first Alien Grunt of this war.

Congratulations! You've officially leveled up from pest control to interdimensional politics. Try not to break the ice too hard, because if this guy ever gets out, the word "fun" is going to take on a whole new meaning.
