The Mario Roman is less a foe and more a walking tribute to everyone's favorite plumber. Sporting a red helmet emblazoned with an "M" and wielding a water-sprayer reminiscent of FLUDD from Super Mario Sunshine. Reminding everyone you've just beaten a plumber cosplayer in ancient Gaul.

TIPS:

- No need for full-on war-one well-timed punch will deflate him like a wet balloon.
- After defeating him, you claim one helmet.
