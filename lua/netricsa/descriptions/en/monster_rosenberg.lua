DESCRIPTION:

Dr. Rosenberg is a senior Black Mesa scientist and one of the most experienced minds working within the facility. Recognized by his white hair and calm demeanor, Rosenberg specializes in teleportation theory and interdimensional research, giving him a crucial role in understanding Xen technology and resonance phenomena.
During the Black Mesa incident, Rosenberg proved to be one of the few scientists capable of remaining composed under catastrophic pressure. His priority became survival and evacuation, both for himself and his colleagues. Despite his lack of combat ability, Rosenberg's knowledge of teleportation systems and evacuation protocols made him a critical ally to security personnel and surviving staff.
Though fragile and unarmed, Rosenberg's value lies in intellect, not combat - his survival ensures that the most sensitive Black Mesa knowledge does not die with the incident.
