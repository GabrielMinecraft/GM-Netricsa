DESCRIPTION:

Alpha Scientist Zombies are former Black Mesa researchers infected and mutated by Headcrabs into fool forms. Unlike common headcrab zombies, alphas -  YOUR TAKING TOO LONG.

Their grotesque transformation leaves parts of the host's lab coat fused with alien tissue, giving them a twisted, intellectual yet monstrous appearance. 

TIPS:

- Firearms or explosives work best; avoid melee if possible.
- Watch for ambushes - they often appear where scientists once worked.
