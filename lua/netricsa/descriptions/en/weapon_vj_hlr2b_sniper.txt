ROF:         Semi-automatic, ~30 rds/min

DESCRIPTION:

Prototype sniper rifle developed for Combine elite snipers during early stages of occupation. Equipped with a precision scope, it fires hyper-velocity rounds capable of instantly neutralizing lightly armored or unshielded targets. Unlike the later MK2, this version had a more experimental design.

- Semi-automatic fire allows for quicker follow-up shots than MK2.
- Rare and restricted to Combine elite sniper units.
- Represents the transition toward the finalized Overwatch Sniper Rifle MK2.
