DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Soldier Medic is a specialized battlefield support unit, visually distinguished from standard soldiers by its white armor with red medical stripes running down the sides of the legs, yellow visor lenses, and the unmistakable inscription "MEDICAL ASSISTANCE" emblazoned across its back.

Unlike regular infantry, Medics are tasked with keeping Overwatch squads in fighting condition during prolonged engagements. Equipped with bioscanners and portable healing injectors, they can rapidly stabilize wounded soldiers, administer Combine-made stimulants, and extend the combat endurance of entire units.

Though primarily support-oriented, they remain heavily armed and will not hesitate to engage enemies directly if threatened. Their presence ensures that Combine squads are much harder to eliminate, often forcing resistance fighters into drawn-out firefights.

TIPS:

- Target Medics first - their healing will prolong battles significantly.
- Watch for him -  every a wounded Combine Soldier may suddenly recover to full strength.
