DESCRIPTION:

The Gonarch is the final and most terrifying stage in the headcrab life cycle. It is a colossal, spider-like matriarch with a grotesque egg sac dangling beneath its body, producing endless numbers of headcrabs. Worshiped-or feared-by lesser parasites, it serves as both breeder and commander of the infestation. Encountered in the deepest realms of Xen, the Gonarch charges its prey with towering legs, spits acid, and unleashes swarms of newborn headcrabs. Its distorted screeches echo through caverns like a nightmarish battle cry.

Legends suggest that every infestation of headcrabs ultimately traces back to a Gonarch. Killing one is no small feat-few have ever survived such an encounter. But you're not one of those lucky ones, are you?

TIPS:

- Focus fire on the abdomen sac to weaken it.
- Keep moving-its charges are deadly in confined spaces.
- Be ready for endless waves of headcrabs during the fight.
