GENMOD-262'S SNARK FROM UH-1


CLASS:      Xen Fauna

PERCEPTION: Sharp (fast reflexes, detects threats instantly)
SIZE:       ~1 ft
ENDURANCE:  Low (fragile individually, but extremely hard to hit)
HOSTILITY:  Extreme (attacks anything not allied)
WEAPONS:    Bite, Claws, Explosive on Death
REWARD:     150 FC
THREAT:     High (due to speed and numbers)

DESCRIPTION:

These Snarks are spawned directly from Genmod-262 in the UH-1 universe. Unlike ordinary snarks, they are exceptionally fast and unpredictable, making them extremely difficult to hit or control. They move in chaotic patterns, swarming targets and exploding upon death, causing additional damage to nearby enemies.

Despite their small size, their aggression and sheer numbers make them a serious hazard in any encounter. Even experienced combatants struggle to contain them once they appear.

TIPS:

- Keep moving-static targets are quickly overwhelmed.
- Use area-of-effect weapons to counter swarms.
- Avoid close quarters; their explosive death can be lethal in tight spaces.
- Target the source (Genmod-262) to stop further spawning.
