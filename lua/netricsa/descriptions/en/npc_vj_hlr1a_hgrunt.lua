DESCRIPTION:

Alpha H.E.C.U. Grunts are the first wave of soldiers deployed into resonance zones. Their equipment and combat training differ from the standard units: lighter armor, simplified tactical protocols, and a focus on fast shock assaults. They move aggressively and recklessly, often charging into combat without proper coordination.

Unlike the main H.E.C.U. divisions, these units rarely rely on ambushes or advanced maneuvers. Their primary role is rapid penetration and clearance of hostile areas at any cost, even if casualties are high. Because of this, Alpha H.E.C.U. are often considered expendable forces, sent ahead as living probes to weaken resistance before the main squads arrive.

TIPS:

- Susceptible to suppression under heavy fire.
- Use grenades more frequently than regular soldiers.
- Dangerous in close quarters but poorly suited for prolonged engagements.
