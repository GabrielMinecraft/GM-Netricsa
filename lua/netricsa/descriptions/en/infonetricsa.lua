WELCOME TO NETRICSA!


Hello, 

I am NETRICSA - NEuroTRonically Implanted Combat Situation Analyzer. I will guide you through your missions by analyzing new environments, enemies and items.

When I have a new message for you, press USE button to invoke me and read it.

If you encounter a strange artefact, I will allow you to analyze it by pressing the USE button.

Now read through your first mission briefing, then select EXIT to start playing.

Good luck!
