DESCRIPTION:

The M24, commonly known as the "stick grenade," is a classic fragmentation weapon widely used in 20th-century warfare. Its wooden handle allows for increased throwing distance compared to traditional hand grenades, making it highly effective in both open fields and trench combat.

Unlike modern grenades, the M24 relies on a timed fuse, ignited by pulling a cord concealed in the handle cap. Upon detonation, it delivers a powerful concussive blast, capable of crippling robots groups, light fortifications, or clustered machinery. Its simple design made it reliable and mass-produced across countless battlefields.

NOTES:

- Best used for clearing bunkers, trenches, or tight defensive positions.
- Has a delay - throw with timing and cover.
- Deadly in groups: synchronized throws can overwhelm even fortified enemies.
