DESCRIPTION:

An executed Sirian soldier, raised from the dead by Mental and remote controlled by Life Control Unit (LCU). 
The Commando carries his own head in one hand to receive audio/visual information. Being a highly trained, veteran soldier of the Beheaded Corps., surviving through many battles, the Commando is a lot more harder to kill than its newbie comrades. It fires five magic missiles at a time from the magic-missile launcher installed in its head. It also launches five bombs with a single throw. They also have another tactic: when they feel that they are about to fall, they charge at their enemies and blow themselves up when close enough. They're immune to their own missiles, but not their bombs.

TIPS:

- Beware their rain of bombs.
- When hurt enough, they will switch to kamikaze mode.
