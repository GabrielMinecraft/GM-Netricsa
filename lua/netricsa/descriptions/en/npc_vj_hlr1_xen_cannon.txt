DESCRIPTION:

The Xen Sentry Cannon is an autonomous turret deployed by the Alien Grunts within Xen. It is features a metallic base with four long prongs that pivot in any direction, unleashing a formidable blue energy beam at intruders. Despite its alien design, the cannon behaves like a man-made weapon platform-when destroyed, its structure crumbles like concrete.

TIPS:

- Approach carefully-the cannon activates when it senses movement.
- Use ranged weapons to destroy it from a safe distance.
- Explosives are especially effective at disabling it quickly.
