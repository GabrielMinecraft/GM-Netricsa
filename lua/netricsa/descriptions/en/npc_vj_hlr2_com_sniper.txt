DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Sniper Soldier is a specialized transhuman unit designed for long-range elimination and suppression. Unlike other Combine infantry, their appearance is more ragged and toned down - their visors lack the iconic glowing optics to avoid giving away their position. This allows them to blend into ruins, rooftops, or prison watchtowers, making them difficult to detect until it's too late.

They are masters of patience and precision, typically holding overwatch positions for hours while tracking enemy movement. Their sniper rifles can eliminate targets with a single shot, sowing panic in squads and forcing survivors into cover.

Sniper Soldiers are often deployed to protect key Combine assets, guard prison exteriors like Nova Prospekt, and create kill zones in city streets. Silent, deadly, and nearly invisible until they fire.

TIPS:

- Avoid staying in the open - always move between cover.
- Smoke grenades or explosives can flush them out.
