DESCRIPTION:

Barney Calhoun began his life as a humble security guard at Black Mesa, one of the countless workers caught up in the Resonance Cascade disaster. A survivor of the catastrophe, he later resurfaced in City 17 under Combine occupation. Now, Barney acts as a vital member of the Resistance, serving as both a fighter and an infiltrator.

Operating under the guise of a Civil Protection officer, Barney often smuggles information, weapons, and supplies to the Resistance. His quick wit, sarcastic humor, and improvisational skills make him both a morale booster and a cunning operative. Despite his casual, joking demeanor, Barney is deeply committed to the fight against the Combine and puts his life on the line for his friends and comrades.

He maintains a close friendship with Gordon Freeman and shares a brotherly bond with Alyx and Eli Vance, making him one of the Resistance's most trusted operatives. Though not as agile as Alyx or as superhuman as Gordon, Barney's reliability and experience in both Black Mesa and Combine-occupied Earth make him an invaluable ally.

TIPS:

- Reliable backup in combat-provides covering fire and tactical support.
- Often acts as a guide, helping resistance fighters through Combine territory.
- His disguise as Civil Protection allows him to infiltrate enemy ranks unnoticed.
