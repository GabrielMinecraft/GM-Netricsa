DESCRIPTION:

Refugees are ordinary civilians who have fled the Combine occupation zones. Untrained, they survive by scavenging for food, shelter, and medical supplies. Many are displaced families, elderly individuals, or children, forced to navigate war-torn cities under constant threat from Combine patrols and Synths.

While not combatants, refugees can provide valuable intelligence about enemy movements or terrain. They often travel in groups for safety and may be escorted or protected by Resistance fighters. Their morale is fragile, and witnessing violence can lead to panic or disorientation.

TIPS:

- Protect refugees whenever possible-they are vulnerable but critical for story missions.
- They may follow players or Resistance units, creating temporary crowd hazards.
- Refugees sometimes carry minor supplies or knowledge of hidden safe routes.
