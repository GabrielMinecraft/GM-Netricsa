BLACK MESA, BATTLEFIELD


The ruins stretch like a broken jaw - Xen, H.E.C.U., and Mental turned the district into a smashed-together war exhibit. The Lambda team is almost within reach. Only a little distance left. Only a ruins of fire, steel and artillery between now and the people who might actually stop this.

Current objective is simple and stupidly dangerous: locate the surviving guard, get him to the sealed access door, and protect him while he opens it. He's the keycard and the codes. Once the door is open, his job is done - you don't need to babysit him afterward. Extraction priority: door first, everybody else second.
