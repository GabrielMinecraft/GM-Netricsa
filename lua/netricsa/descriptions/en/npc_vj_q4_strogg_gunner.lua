DESCRIPTION:

The Gunner is a formidable Strogg unit, imposing in stature and deadly in ranged combat. It has a Nailgun grafted in place of its right forearm and a Grenade Launcher that it uses to lob bouncing explosives toward its target. When it fires grenades, it gives a visible warning, cocking its launcher arm before unleashing the shot. 

Unlike melee-oriented Stroggs, the Gunner prefers to sit back, guard corridors or rooms, suppress enemies with nails, and support heavier units. Its slower movement makes it less mobile than others, but its ranged power compensates greatly. Underestimating a Gunner can be deadly-its barrage of nails and timed grenades can shred through health and armour if you get caught in the open. 

TIPS:

- Heavy weapons or explosive attacks work best-machine gun fire takes many shots.
- Engage at mid-range: close range means you risk getting hit by both nailgun shots and grenades.
