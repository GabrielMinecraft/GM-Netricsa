DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Shotgun Prison Soldier serves as the heavy enforcer of Nova Prospekt. Unlike standard Prison Soldiers, these units are outfitted with shotguns for brutal suppression of uprisings, cell block breaches, or attempted escapes. Their tactics focus on fear and overwhelming close-range firepower, often charging down narrow corridors to blast targets at point-blank range.

The use of shotgun units in prisons is deliberate - their destructive power in close quarters ensures that prisoners rarely survive escape attempts. Their lighter armor, compared to front-line Shotgun Soldiers, makes them more agile in the confined halls of Nova Prospekt, though still far tougher than standard infantry.

Loyal to the Combine to the core, these soldiers act as executioners in riots and as shock troops during mass prisoner "processing." Encountering one in the dim corridors of the prison usually means death is seconds away.

TIPS:

- Keep distance - their shotguns are devastating up close.
- Use explosives or rapid fire to thin out their squads before they close in.
- Supplies are sometimes stored in armories near Shotgun unit patrol routes.
