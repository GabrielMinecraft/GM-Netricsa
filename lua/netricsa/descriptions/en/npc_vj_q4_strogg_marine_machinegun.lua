DESCRIPTION:

Machine Gun Guards are one of the most common Strogg infantry types. These former human soldiers have been surgically converted into half-mechanical drones, their right arms replaced with heavy machine guns. Despite their crude cybernetics, they are efficient combatants, laying down suppressive fire with frightening intensity.

Their targeting systems are imprecise, causing their gunfire to sweep erratically from side to side, but their sheer volume of bullets makes them deadly at close to mid-range. They often patrol industrial corridors or guard key installations, serving as expendable frontline troops.

TIPS:

- Despite being weak, the Machine Gun Guard can inflict a decent amount of damage if you're close to it. Try to get away from it if you see it, then attack.
- Any weapon works against it, but the Machine Gun should be used to conserve ammo for stronger weapons. Shotgun is good if they come close.
- A group of Machine Gun Guards can be quite powerful, so try to destroy them as soon as you can.
- Explosives can take out most of a group in one hit.
- With other enemies, the Machine Gun Guard is cannon-fodder. It will merely distract you while you attack stronger targets, so try to get rid of it as soon as you can.
