DESCRIPTION:

This towering snowman-like creature is a bizarre hive. It is slow-moving and harmless as long as it is left undisturbed. The Snowman wears a top hat and carries a small sign with a penguin drawing and the warning: "Beware The Penguins!" Inside its frosty body, it houses a large number of penguins, each strapped with a grenade. When the Snowman is killed, the penguins erupt from its body, attacking anyone nearby with explosive chaos. Its unusual appearance and deadly hidden cargo make it a unique threat.

TIPS:

- Avoid killing the Snowman unless prepared for a swarm of grenades.
- Observe from a safe distance; it poses no threat if untouched.
- Use long-range weapons to eliminate it while minimizing exposure to the penguins.
