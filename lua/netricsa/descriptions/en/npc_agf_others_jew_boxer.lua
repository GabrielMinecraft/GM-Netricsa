DESCRIPTION:

Never challenge John Jeewich, the Unrivaled Boxer, unless you wish to witness the collapse of your own skeleton. This man can crush not only a walnut but entire trees - and possibly your ribs - with a single hand. Known as the Fear of All Germany, his fists hit like industrial hammers forged in a storm.

Legends say only one being can defeat him: Saitama - One Punch, One Death.

However, your fists will be enough in a fair fistfight.

TIPS:

- Do not stand still - motion is your only defense.
- If you're not Saitama, you won't survive a direct hit.
- His punches can shatter metal and bone alike.
