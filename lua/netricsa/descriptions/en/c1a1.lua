BLACK MESA,  LASER ROOM


Sam, structural scans confirm that you are still inside the Anomalous Materials sector, but the environment has been radically altered. The cascade resonance destabilized the entire power grid - conduits are ruptured, and containment systems are failing everywhere.

You have entered a chamber where high-energy lasers are violently discharging from broken pipes and ruptured emitters. Originally, these beams were part of the spectrometer's stabilization array. Now they are completely out of control, cutting through walls, equipment, and, judging by the charred remains on the floor, anyone unfortunate enough to be in their path.

Be cautious. These are not decorative light shows - a single misstep means instant disintegration. On the bright side, the lasers have also reduced the number of hostile lifeforms in the area. Think of it as an automatic defense system... that does not distinguish between friend and foe.
