DESCRIPTION:

Classic German infantrymen of the Second World War, the Nazi Soldiers are loyal to their regime and trained to fight with ruthless efficiency. Armed primarily with the MP-40, they excel in close-to-mid-range combat and often move in squads to cover each other's advances. Their unwavering service to Germany makes them both determined and dangerous.

In battle, they rely on suppressive fire, ambush tactics, and sheer numbers. While their equipment is not as advanced as future armies, their discipline and coordination make them formidable foes in the field.

TIPS:

- Keep your distance; the MP-40 is most effective at close range.
- Grenades can disrupt squads before they overwhelm you.
- Use cover to avoid concentrated bursts.
- Isolate soldiers from their group to neutralize them more easily.
