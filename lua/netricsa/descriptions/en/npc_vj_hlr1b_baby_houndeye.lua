DESCRIPTION:

The Baby Houndeye is a juvenile Xen predator, smaller and less dangerous than adults. It resembles a miniature cross between a dog and a porcupine, emitting weak sonic pulses that can startle but rarely cause serious damage.

Although individually harmless, Baby Houndeyes are highly social and often follow their parents or pack members, coordinating attacks when threatened. Their high-pitched squeals can alert nearby adults, making encounters potentially dangerous in the wild.

TIPS:

- Keep distance; their sonic pulses can disorient in confined spaces.
- Avoid provoking them alone - packs are protective.
- Environmental hazards can be used to manage packs effectively.
