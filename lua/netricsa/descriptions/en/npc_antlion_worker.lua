DESCRIPTION:

Antlion Workers are the industrial crafters and protectors of the colony. Originating from Xen, these blind insects use acidic spit to carve intricate tunnels in rocky terrain, sustaining the hive infrastructure and guarding larval chambers against intruders. Though not as aggressive as Soldiers or Guards, they can become formidable when defending their grubs-especially in tight underground spaces.

TIPS:

- Use ranged attacks to keep your distance while avoiding close-quarter ambushes.
- Their acidic spit is dangerous; quick movement and evasive maneuvers help minimize exposure.
