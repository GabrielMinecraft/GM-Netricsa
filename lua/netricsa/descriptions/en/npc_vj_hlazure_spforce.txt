Special Forces of Sector Delta are an elite military unit under the direct command of the man in a business suit who carries a suitcase. They are hostile to all factions - Black Mesa personnel, HECU, and Xen creatures alike. Highly trained and armored, they operate with ruthless efficiency, often storming research facilities or Xen outposts to secure anomalous artifacts.

They employ superior coordination, advanced weaponry, and heavy support, including vehicles and sentry guns. Encounters with them are marked by overwhelming firepower and tactical precision, making them one of the deadliest threats in the conflict.
