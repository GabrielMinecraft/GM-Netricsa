DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Dropship is a massive transport synth used by the Combine to deploy troops rapidly across battle zones. It has a whale-shark-like front, multiple lifting “legs” (engine pods), retractable wings for maneuvering, and large cargo containers with strong pulse turrets affixed to the front to suppress opposition as troops disembark. 

Though the Dropship itself is invulnerable to most  weapons, its containers can be destroyed (usually needing about 4 RPG hits) to reduce its effectiveness. It carries several Overwatch or Civil Protection units inside. The Dropship also sometimes spreads Rollermines over coastal or open areas. 


TIPS:

- Target the container, especially the pulse turret, for a chance to stop its deployment of troops.
- Use RPGs or heavy explosives-regular weapons are nearly useless.
- Keep moving-standing under a Dropship’s deployment zone is dangerous.
- Watch for mine drops (Rollermines) when it flies over vulnerable areas.
