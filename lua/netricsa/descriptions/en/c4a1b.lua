XEN, FORGE ISLAND


Nihilanth whispers: "You will die. You will all die" Charming.

Vortigaunts run the strange machines. The island hums: organics and machinery fused into a production line.

What's here

Gargantua patrols the open decks - heavy, brutal, and single-minded.

Tentacles guard the verticals; they punish noise and poorly timed jumps.

Active portal somewhere on the island - it links to the infantry-production halls.

Vortigaunts are working, not immediately hostile if you donâ€™t start a firefight.
