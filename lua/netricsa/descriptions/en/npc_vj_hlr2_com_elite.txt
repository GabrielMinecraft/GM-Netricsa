DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Soldier Elite is the highest-ranking ground unit deployed by the Combine on Earth. Recognizable by their stark white armor and a single, ominous glowing red eye, they serve as both enforcers and shock troops in large-scale operations. Their advanced synthetic implants grant them superior reflexes, endurance, and battlefield awareness compared to standard Overwatch soldiers.

Elites are deployed only when resistance activity escalates beyond the capacity of ordinary units. They are feared for their brutal efficiency, heavy use of the AR2 pulse rifle, and their coordinated tactics, often combining suppression fire with energy balls to flush enemies out of cover.

Their armor is reinforced against small-arms fire, making them highly resilient opponents. Their presence often signals that the Combine has shifted to full-scale extermination or suppression, leaving rebels with little room for retreat.

TIPS:

- Pulse Rifle fire is devastating - use cover and keep moving.
- Explosives and heavy weapons are the most effective way to bring them down.
- They often operate in squads - never assume an Elite is working alone.
- The red visor can give away their position in low light.
