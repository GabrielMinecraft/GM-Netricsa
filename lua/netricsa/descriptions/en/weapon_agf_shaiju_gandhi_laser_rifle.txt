DESCRIPTION:

Created in the secret laboratories of Lord Anton, the Experimental Laser Rifle is a cutting-edge directed-energy weapon that harnesses raw electricity to fire searing beams of light. Capable of cutting through metal and flesh alike, it is considered one of the deadliest prototypes ever fielded.
Only a few chosen soldiers are trusted to wield it, while others fear it as a tool too unstable - and too destructive - to be widely deployed.

NOTES:

- Melts through armored infantry with ease.
- Absolutely forbidden to let it fall into enemy hands.
