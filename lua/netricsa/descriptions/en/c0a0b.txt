BLACK MESA, TRAIN - PART 3


Sam, the tram is nearing lower levels of the facility. External sensors just picked up the unmistakable signature of a military helicopter stationed aboveground. This is unusual: research centers rarely keep heavy gunships parked unless they expect serious trouble.
My analysis: Black Mesa is not just a lab, it's a fortress. Whoever runs this place values secrecy at a level that even Mental could appreciate. Keep in mind, military hardware of this class doesn't just guard.
