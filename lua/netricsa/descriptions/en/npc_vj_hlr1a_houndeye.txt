DESCRIPTION:

The Alpha Houndeye is a small, Xen predator resembling a cross between a dog and an overexcited porcupine. It hunts in packs, relying on sonic pulses to disorient prey before closing in for the attack. Despite its seemingly goofy appearance and high-pitched squeals, a pack of Houndeyes can overwhelm even well-armed intruders.

These creatures are highly social and communicate via ultrasonic shrieks that can rupture eardrums at close range. Scientists speculate their explosive sonic attacks are an evolutionary adaptation to compensate for their weak claws and teeth.

TIPS:

- Engage Houndeyes from a distance to avoid their shockwaves.
- Shooting one may provoke the whole pack - beware.
- Exploit their pack mentality: luring them into environmental hazards can turn their coordination against them.
