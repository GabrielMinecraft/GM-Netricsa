DESCRIPTION:

Dr. Arne Magnusson is one of the senior leaders of the Resistance, overseeing operations from the White Forest base. Gruff, impatient, and often critical, he has little tolerance for mistakes-but beneath his abrasive exterior lies an unshakable dedication to humanity's survival.

A veteran of Black Mesa, Magnusson is a survivor of the Resonance Cascade and carries both the scars and knowledge of that disaster. His engineering genius gave birth to the Magnusson Device, an experimental explosive weapon designed specifically to destroy Combine Striders. Despite its unconventional nature, the device proved to be one of the Resistance's greatest tools in turning the tide of battle.

Though he is no frontline soldier, Magnusson commands respect and fear in equal measure among Resistance ranks. His brilliance is matched only by his short temper, and yet in critical moments, his leadership is indispensable.

TIPS:

- His Magnusson Devices are the key to destroying Striders-use them wisely.
- His bark is worse than his bite-ignore the shouting, follow the plan.
- Keep him alive-his knowledge of the Combine is irreplaceable.ckly.
- Be prepared for constant criticism about the microwave in Black Mesa.
