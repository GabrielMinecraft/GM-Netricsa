XMASXMAS, THE LOST WINTER MAP


The map xmasxmas.bsp is one of the few surviving works of the mysterious Garry's Mod mapper known as zerozerozero, who vanished from the internet in 2013 under strange circumstances.

At first glance, the map appears deceptively simple - a frozen desert, a broken car, and a single crow standing in the snow. But those who have played it know that something is wrong. The crow isn't normal. When it dies, the game's frame rate collapses, and sv_cheats suddenly activates. Investigation showed that the map secretly contained six hidden lua_run entities, endlessly sending requests to a dead server.

Further testing revealed different results across Source games - in Half-Life 2 the crow behaved normally, while in TF2 the player spawned outside the map and crashed within minutes

When the map was cleaned of its scripts and the crow was killed again, the player's model stretched and distorted, and a single message appeared in the console: "Photograph!!!".
