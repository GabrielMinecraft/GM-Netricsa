BLACK MESA, TRAIN - PART 5


Interesting. Another tram is moving parallel to yours. More interesting: one passenger is clearly watching you. Male, business attire, carrying a black briefcase.
He doesn't match the scientist profiles in my database, nor does he resemble standard military personnel. My algorithms cannot confirm his identity, but... there's something calculated about the way he studies you.
Recommendation: remember his face, Sam. People like that don't just "happen" to be in the wrong place at the right time.
