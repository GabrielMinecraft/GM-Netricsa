DESCRIPTION:

The Ichthyosaur is a terrifying aquatic predator brought from Xen during the resonance cascade. Though resembling a mutated shark or reptile, it is an alien species adapted for underwater combat. With its enormous jaws and powerful tail, it moves with frightening speed in its element, often attacking from below before the victim realizes it's there. On land it is helpless, but in water it is king-fast, relentless, and nearly impossible to escape. Survivors of Black Mesa remember it as one of the most feared creatures unleashed during the incident.

TIPS:

Avoid deep water whenever possible.

- Use explosives or rapid fire-melee is suicide.
- Stay near the surface; visibility gives you a chance to react.
