BLACK MESA, GARGANTUA INTERCEPTION


Sam, the situation escalated-fast. The collapse dropped you deeper into the facility, right into a railway sector designed for heavy cargo. Unfortunately, this area has become a playground for something far less logistical: a Gargantua-class bio-behemoth.

This monster isn't just another alien brute-it's an apex predator engineered for war. Its claws rip steel apart like paper, and its energy arcs can incinerate squads in seconds. Attempting to fight it with standard weapons would be suicide.

Complications:

The cargo train here is the only viable transport to the next sectors. Without it, you're stuck.

However, power is offline. The rail system can't run until you restore electricity elsewhere.

To make things stranger, sensors once again picked up the presence of the mysterious man in a business suit, quietly observing from the shadows of the platform.

Recommendation: avoid direct confrontation. The Gargantua be destroyed with your current explosive arsenal. Focus on re-establishing power to the cargo rail, then use the train to escape.
