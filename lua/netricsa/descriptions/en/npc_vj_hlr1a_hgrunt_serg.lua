DESCRIPTION:

The Alpha H.E.C.U. Sergeant  represents the heaviest infantry deployed during large-scale containment operations. Towering above standard marines, these sergeants carry a rotary-barrel minigun capable of shredding cover and suppressing entire squads with overwhelming firepower.

Their armor plating is reinforced to withstand small arms fire, allowing them to advance steadily under heavy resistance. Unlike most heavy gunners, they are also trained in brutal close-quarters combat - crushing blows, combat knives, and takedown techniques make them lethal even if their minigun is disabled or runs dry.

Encountering such a unit usually means command has deemed the area critically important and will stop at nothing to erase resistance.

TIPS:

- Never face them head-on: their minigun will suppress and overwhelm instantly.
- Explosives or coordinated fire are required to break their armor.
- In close range, treat them as dangerous as an Alien Grunt - their melee is devastating.
