BLACK MESA LAMBDA REACTOR, QUIET BEFORE THE NEXT STORM


The corridor opens into a small, control room. Inside, a lone scientist stands, pale, wired, and absolutely refusing to play hero. He will not open the door until he is certain the immediate area is clear - not "mostly dead", not "probably dead", but definitely dead. Paranoia is an excellent survival trait in this place, and he has it in spades.

They want to hand over the prototype Gluon Cannon - a nasty little answer to very big problems. It is dangerous, experimental, and precisely the sort of thing you want when the next wave is not just another set of grunts.

Mission snapshot:

Objective: clear the immediate corridors and confirm "no hostile signatures" to the scientist.

Reward: access to the Gluon Cannon and full entry into the reactor core area.
