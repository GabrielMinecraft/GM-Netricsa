DESCRIPTION:

Antlions are insectoid predators from Xen, drawn to Earth before the Combine's incursion. They roam sandy areas in swarms, bursting from beneath the ground to ambush prey. Agile and relentless, they overwhelm with sheer numbers rather than individual strength. Despite their aggression, they can be pacified or even commanded through the use of special pheropods harvested from Antlion Guards corpses. Their insect-like buzzing heralds an incoming attack, often moments before the sand erupts beneath your feet.

TIPS:

- Avoid walk on sand; vibrations attract them instantly.
- Use pheropods to turn swarms into allies.
