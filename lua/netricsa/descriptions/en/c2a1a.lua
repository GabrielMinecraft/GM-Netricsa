BLACK MESA, POWER RESTORATION SECTOR


Sam, you've reached the main junction for the rail power grid. This is the heart of the problem: the electrical lines feeding the cargo train have been deliberately shut down. Whether it was safety protocols during the cascade... or sabotage by the soldiers, doesn't matter. Without restoring this system, you're not leaving.

Complications:

The area is swarming with H.E.C.U. marines, who clearly know the importance of this sector. They've set up barricades, tripmines, and kill-zones across the maintenance rooms.

Sensors confirm a Black Ops detachment has entered a distant sector of the facility. They aren't here yet-but the clock is ticking. Once they arrive, you won't just be fighting HECU; you'll be caught in a crossfire between rival human forces that both want you dead.

The power relays are hidden behind layers of broken corridors and half-flooded maintenance shafts. Expect ambushes at every step.

Objective:

Locate and reactivate the primary power relay.

Clear enough soldiers to secure the sector long enough for the systems to come online.

Survive until you can return to the cargo train and get the hell out.
