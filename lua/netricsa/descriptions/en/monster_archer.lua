DESCRIPTION:

The Archer is a red-colored aquatic predator from Xen. It lurks in pools and flooded passages, ambushing prey with bursts of acidic spit. If approached too closely, it lunges with sharp jaws. Archers are aggressive, territorial, and will often attack on sight, spitting volleys before closing in for the kill.

TIPS:

- Keep distance and move unpredictably to avoid spit.
- Best dealt with using explosives or rapid fire while keeping out of water.
- Dangerous in groups - isolate them if possible.
