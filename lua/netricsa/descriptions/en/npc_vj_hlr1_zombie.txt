DESCRIPTION:

The Common Headcrab Zombie is a tragic fusion of a human host and a common Headcrab. Unlike Earth variants, the common Headcrab burrows itself permanently into the host's skull, leaving the human's cranium visible beneath its alien carapace. Once infected, the host loses all free will and becomes a slow-moving, relentless predator.

These Headcrab zombies are cumbersome and easy to avoid at a distance, but they are relentless and will pursue prey until close enough to strike. The permanent bond of the Headcrab makes this creature a horrifying reminder of Xen's parasitic ingenuity - no mercy, no escape, just a walking, groaning conduit for alien aggression.

TIPS:

- Keep distance; melee attacks are dangerous if they connect.
- Firearms work well due to their slow movement.
- Don't underestimate groups â€” while individually slow, they can corner prey easily.
