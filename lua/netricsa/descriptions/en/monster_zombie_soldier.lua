DESCRIPTION:

Zombie H.E.C.U. are former Hazardous Environment Combat Unit soldiers infected by Xen Headcrabs. Their military training is gone, leaving only the alien parasite in control. They retain the imposing bulk of H.E.C.U. armor, making them more resilient than ordinary headcrab zombies.

These zombies are slow but relentless, using brute force to grapple and maim anyone nearby. Encounters are particularly terrifying in hallways or confined spaces, as the H.E.C.U. armor provides additional protection.

TIPS:

- Keep distance - their melee strikes are strong and can pin targets.
- Firearms are effective due to slow movement.
- Beware groups - their combined mass and armor can corner prey easily.
