DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Prison Soldier is a specialized unit assigned to enforce order within Combine-controlled detention facilities, most notably the infamous Nova Prospekt. Stripped of individuality and heavily conditioned for obedience, these soldiers patrol prison blocks, escort prisoners, and suppress riots with ruthless efficiency.

Their armor is lighter than that of frontline Overwatch units, optimized for maneuvering through corridors and confined spaces. Prison Soldiers are usually armed with AR2 or SMGs.

Though not as resilient as Shotgun Soldiers or standard infantry, they are deadly in their own environment - the labyrinthine halls of Nova Prospekt, where escape is almost impossible and prisoners are "processed" into something far worse.

TIPS:

- They often attack in squads; isolating one can give you an advantage.
- Supplies are often carried on their belts or hidden in Nova Prospekt's storage areas.
