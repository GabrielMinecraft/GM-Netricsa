DESCRIPTION:

The Rollermine is a small but dangerous autonomous weapon deployed by the Combine as an area-denial tool. Designed to roll rapidly across terrain, these spherical devices use magnetic attraction to cling to vehicles or enemies, shocking them with bursts of high-voltage electricity.

While individually weak, Rollermines excel in swarms, disrupting resistance movements, ambushing squads, and halting vehicles by latching onto them. Their lightweight shell makes them vulnerable to small-arms fire, but their agility and relentless homing behavior make them frustrating to eliminate in the heat of combat.

When destroyed, their unstable Combine core can explosive.

TIPS:

- Use the Gravity Gun to punt Rollermines away or fling them back at enemies.
- Keep moving; they are fast but predictable when homing in.
