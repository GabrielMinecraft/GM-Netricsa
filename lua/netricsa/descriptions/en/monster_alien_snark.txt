DESCRIPTION:

The Snark is basically a cockroach that drank too much coffee and decided violence was a lifestyle. Native to Xen, these tiny creatures are released from eggs like organic grenades. Once set loose, they immediately scurry toward the nearest lifeform, biting furiously with zero sense of self-preservation.

Unfortunately for them (but lucky for you), they also have a hilariously short lifespan - if they don't kill you quickly, they just explode in a puff of gory enthusiasm. Resistance fighters often joke that Snarks are "suicide bombers with ADHD."

TIPS:

- Don't panic. One Snark is just comic relief.
- A dozen Snarks? Comedy turns into horror.

Pro tip: 

- Toss them into a crowd of enemies for maximum chaos.
