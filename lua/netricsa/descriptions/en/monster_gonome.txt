DESCRIPTION:

The Gonome represents a grotesque evolution of the Common Headcrab Zombie. After prolonged infection or exposure to specific conditions, the host undergoes significant physical transformation. The Gonome's chest cavity expands into a functional maw, capable of launching organic projectiles. Despite the host's increased body mass, the controlling Headcrab appears to wither, leaving visible skeletal features beneath the skin. Gonomes exhibit aggressive behavior, often charging at intruders and utilizing their clawed limbs and biting attacks.

TIPS:

- Maintain distance; their sprinting charge can overwhelm unprepared foes.
- Avoid close-quarters combat due to their powerful bite and claw attacks.
- Explosives or rapid-fire weapons are effective for neutralizing them from afar.
