DESCRIPTION:

The Light Tank is a towering Strogg Living war machine. Standing about 8 feet tall, this beast is slow but dangerous. It combines ranged pyrotechnics and brutal melee power: it can spew flames, launch "drunken" bolts that zigzag, or charge and throw a massive fireball after a brief buildup. When the distance is closed, its heavy mace arm brings down devastation. 

TIPS:

- Keep your distance and use long-range weapons.
- Though scoring headshots will only deal a little bit more damage, it is still a good idea to go for headshots.
