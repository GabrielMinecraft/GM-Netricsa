DESCRIPTION:

The MP 40 is a classic German submachine gun, widely deployed during the Second World War. Compact, reliable, and easy to handle, it became the standard weapon for paratroopers, tank crews, and infantry squad leaders. Its folding metal stock and streamlined design allowed it to be carried efficiently, while the moderate rate of fire made it controllable in close-quarters engagements.

Although less powerful than a rifle at range, the MP 40 excelled in urban combat, ambushes, and confined spaces, where mobility and suppressive fire mattered most. Known for its iconic profile and distinctive sound, it remains one of the most recognized firearms in history.

NOTES:

- Highly effective in close-quarters combat.
- Limited magazine capacity (32 rounds) - reload often.
- Accuracy drops rapidly at longer ranges.
