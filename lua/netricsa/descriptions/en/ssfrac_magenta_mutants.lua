MAGENTA MUTANTS


Magenta Mutants are twisted, nightmarish variations of familiar creatures from Xen. These creatures are former Black Mesa scientists whose bodies and minds were permanently warped after merging with Xen organisms. The result was a breed whose skin took on a disturbing purple hue.

Their origins date back to a single ill-fated experiment: a scientist fused with a Chumtode in a water pipe, creating the first hybrid creature-the Magenta Slave. The process was repeated again and again until the monstrous fusions spread throughout the Mesa complexes, transforming more and more people into psionic mutants with aggressive, predatory minds.

But the pinnacle of these experiments was Diablo-a colossal monstrosity assembled from human fragments, Vortigaunt DNA, Chumtode biomass, and Xen crystalline matter.
