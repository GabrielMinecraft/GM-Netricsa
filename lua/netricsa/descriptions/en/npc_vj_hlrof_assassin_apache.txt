DESCRIPTION:

The Black Ops Apache is a heavily modified variant of the standard AH-64 attack helicopter, deployed by covert government forces. Unlike its H.E.C.U. counterpart, this version features reinforced armor plating, upgraded avionics, and enhanced weapon payloads, allowing it to dominate both airspace and ground encounters.

Painted in matte-black camouflage with reduced radar signature, it is built for both intimidation and stealth approach. When encountered, it delivers overwhelming firepower, sweeping the battlefield with chainguns and rocket salvos. Survivors often report its relentless pursuit and uncanny accuracy, making escape nearly impossible once it locks on.

Unlike the transport-focused Osprey, the Black Ops Apache exists solely for annihilation. Where it flies, survivors rarely remain.

TIPS:

- Stay under cover - open ground is certain death.
- Rockets are the most reliable method of taking it down.
- Don't linger after damaging it - the retaliation will be brutal.
- Listen for the distinct rotor echo - it's your only warning.
