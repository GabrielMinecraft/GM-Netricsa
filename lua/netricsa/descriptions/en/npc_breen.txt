DESCRIPTION:

Dr. Wallace Breen was the administrator of Black Mesa during the fateful Resonance Cascade, and when Earth fell during the Seven-Hour War, he negotiated its surrender. In return, the Combine installed him as humanity's puppet ruler, with City 17 as his base of operations and the towering Citadel as his seat of power. 

Broadcasting constantly via Breencasts-public addresses over wall monitors and screens-Breen verbally reinforces his control, referring to the Combine as "Our Benefactors" and cloaking his tyranny under a veneer of pragmatism. 

Behind the broadcasts, however, lies calculated opportunism. Breen fetishizes order and legacy, positioning himself as Earth's savior while exploiting his alliance with the Combine to retain personal power-even as humanity suffers. 

TIPS:

- Never believe his words-they're pure propaganda.
