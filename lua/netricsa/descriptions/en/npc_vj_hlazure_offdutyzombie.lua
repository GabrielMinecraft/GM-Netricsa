DESCRIPTION:

OffDuty Zombies are former Black Mesa security guards who were unarmed and unarmored. Infected by Headcrabs, they shuffle aimlessly but attack anything nearby with crude melee strikes. Their lack of armor makes them less resilient than  H.E.C.U., or armored zombies, but they still pose a threat in groups.

The transformation emphasizes the tragic vulnerability of unprepared personnel during the Xen outbreak, turning harmless, sleeping guards into slow-moving predators.

TIPS:

- Keep distance; their attacks are slow but can grab you.
- Firearms are effective; melee is risky.
- Groups can corner prey, so prioritize targets carefully.
