DESCRIPTION:

Citizens are the oppressed human population living under Combine rule in City 17 and beyond. Most endure miserable conditions in dilapidated housing blocks, under constant surveillance and pressure from Civil Protection. Despite their apparent submission, many secretly support the Resistance, offering supplies, information, and safehouses to rebels.

When inspired by leaders such as Eli Vance or Gordon Freeman, citizens take up arms and fight alongside the Resistance. Though poorly trained and lightly armed, their sheer numbers and determination often make them a decisive force against Combine patrols.

Their loyalty, however, comes at a cost: many are captured, "processed", and transformed into Stalkers or Overwatch soldiers. Every armed citizen knows they risk more than death-they risk losing their humanity entirely.

TIPS:

- Weak alone, but dangerous in groups with firearms.
- They can provide ammo, medkits, or act as squadmates if you gain their trust.
