BLACK MESA, OFFICES


Sam, you've just arrived via the elevator into the Black Mesa offices-and the situation is worse than expected. The Mental Army has already beaten you here. Every corner of the laboratory is crawling with their soldiers, tactical units streaming in like a relentless tide. 

Desks, lab benches, and scattered equipment have become battlegrounds. Ambushes can come from any angle: overhead catwalks, storage closets, even ventilation shafts. The once-sterile offices now echo with gunfire, shouts, and the occasional broken coffee machine.

Telemetry confirms that the Mental Army's advance is coordinated; this is no random skirmish. You will need to navigate through corridors riddled with traps, evade enemy patrols, and push forward to secure the command center. Survival depends on speed, observation, and a willingness to improvise.

Your mission: reach the office core, assess the situation, and prepare for the chaos spilling in from adjacent sectors. Sam, the lab is no longer just a workplace-it's a war zone. And the Mental Army is determined to make sure you don't get a seat at the table.
