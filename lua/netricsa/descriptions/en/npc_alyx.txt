DESCRIPTION:

Alyx Vance is one of the central leaders of the human Resistance and the daughter of Eli Vance, head scientist of Black Mesa East. Growing up under Combine oppression, she developed both a sharp wit and exceptional survival skills. Agile, resourceful, and deadly accurate with firearms, Alyx is not only a fighter but also an engineer, capable of hacking Combine interfaces and reprogramming their devices.

Despite the grim world she inhabits, Alyx remains optimistic, compassionate, and fiercely loyal to her allies. Her close bond with Gordon Freeman strengthens the Resistance movement, inspiring others to rise up. Accompanied often by her loyal pet robot Dog, she represents hope in the darkest of times.

Her combat style favors mobility-darting between cover, picking off enemies with precise shots, and using the environment to her advantage. While not heavily armored, her quick reflexes and clever tactics make her one of the Combine's most dangerous adversaries.

TIPS:

- Excellent support ally in battle-don't underestimate her accuracy.
- Can hack Combine machinery to turn the enemy's own weapons against them.
- Without heavy armor, she relies on agility and cover-protect her when overwhelmed.
