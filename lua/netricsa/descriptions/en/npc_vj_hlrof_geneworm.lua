DESCRIPTION:

The Gene Worm is the colossal overlord of Race X, a bioengineered monstrosity that serves as the ultimate weapon in their invasion. Emerging from a dimensional rift, it appears as a massive worm-like titan with grotesque mandibles, armored plating, and pulsating sacs. Its body is designed to terraform and dominate alien environments, seeding terrain with Race X lifeforms while annihilating opposition with devastating attacks.

The creature's biology is a fusion of parasitic tissue and engineered genetics, making it both a living weapon and a mobile birthing chamber. It projects corrosive acid and spawns pods that release aggressive minions to protect it. Its psychic presence can unnerve even trained soldiers, overwhelming minds with alien impulses.

During the Black Mesa Incident, the Gene Worm was the spearhead of the Race X invasion-its successful arrival would have solidified their foothold on Earth. It required heavy military firepower and extreme sacrifice to destroy it before the dimensional breach fully stabilized.

TIPS:

- Aim for the weak spots on the head (eyes) to expose the weak spot.
- Be prepared for minions to spawn constantly; destroy them quickly.
- The only way to defeat this monster is to attack the weak spot on the belly.
