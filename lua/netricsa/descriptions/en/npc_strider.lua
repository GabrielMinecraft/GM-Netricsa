DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Strider is a towering, three-legged war machine and one of the deadliest Synth units deployed by the Combine. Acting as both heavy infantry support and urban siege weapon, Striders combine alien engineering with brutal efficiency.

Standing nearly 20 meters tall, their elongated legs allow them to traverse city blocks, rubble, and buildings with ease. Armed with a devastating pulse cannon for suppressive fire and a terrifying warp-beam disintegrator capable of cutting through buildings, they serve as walking weapons of mass destruction. A single Strider can devastate squads of Resistance fighters, while coordinated groups of them can lay entire districts to waste.

Despite their bulk, Striders are eerily agile, moving with insectoid grace and uncanny precision. They often deploy alongside Combine ground forces, hunters, scanners, and gunships, acting as mobile shock troops and enforcers of Combine control.

TIPS:

- Take cover - their warp-beam can annihilate exposed fighters in seconds.
- RPGs are the most effective weapon against their armor.
- Avoid direct combat; use urban structures for cover and ambushes.
- Striders are rarely alone - prepare for supporting forces (soldiers, hunters, scanners, gunships).
