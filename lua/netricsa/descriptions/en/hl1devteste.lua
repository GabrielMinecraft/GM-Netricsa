BLACK MESA DEVTEST, FORGET ABOUT FREEMAN! (SHORTERED)


In the retail game, this chapter marked a turning point: the H.E.C.U. were ordered to abandon the facility, leaving chaos behind. Long stretches of ruined hallways, last-stand ambushes, and collapsing structures filled the path to Lambda.

The E3 devtest version cuts all of that. Instead of a drawn-out retreat, the is dropped straight into a bombarded corridor, with panicked radio chatter from soldiers. Within moments, it becomes clear: the military is pulling out, and you're no longer their mission.

Here, the goal is immediate - reach Lambda's entrance under fire.
