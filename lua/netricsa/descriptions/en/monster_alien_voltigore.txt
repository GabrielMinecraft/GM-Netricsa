DESCRIPTION:

The Voltigore is a massive quadrupedal beast bred by Race X as living heavy artillery. Its muscular body is covered in thick, chitinous armor that provides excellent protection against conventional weapons. Voltigores are extremely aggressive, charging at prey with their enormous claws and overwhelming size.

Their most devastating ability is the emission of bio-electrical plasma blasts, fired from an organ on their backs. These projectiles explode on impact with devastating power, capable of destroying armored vehicles and obliterating infantry. Their terrifying roars and glowing patterns signal imminent attack, giving them an almost demonic presence on the battlefield.

Though intelligent enough to fight in coordination with other Race X creatures, Voltigores are primarily deployed as shock weapons of terror and destruction.

TIPS:

- Keep maximum distance-their plasma blasts are devastating in close quarters.
- Explosives, rockets, or heavy machine guns are required to bring them down quickly.
- Use cover to bait their plasma attacks before countering.
- Never underestimate their melee power-if they close in, survival chances drop sharply.
