DESCRIPTION:

Monster Generics are the blank canvases of Xen and Black Mesa's predatory life. No one knows their true nature, because they exist primarily as templates in the world - yet when "spawned" in the real world, they take on forms of actual monsters, obeying the rules of their environment.

They can be anything: a snapping alien, a lunging creature, or a bizarre hybrid no one expected.

Some researchers whisper that these creatures are the underlying puppeteers of all other monsters and generic actors - the unseen archetypes from which every clawed, fanged, or tentacled predator is copied. Encountering one feels like meeting a creature that is both generic and uniquely terrifying.

TIPS:

- Expect the unexpected: appearance and attacks vary wildly.
- Exploit environmental traps, as Monster Generics are prone to follow everyone literally.
- Don't assume familiarity - every encounter can be different.
