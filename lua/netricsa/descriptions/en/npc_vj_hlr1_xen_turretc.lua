DESCRIPTION:

The Xen Ceiling Turret is an automated defense system used by the alien residents of Xen. Resembling a techno-organic structure, it consists of a fleshy stem hanging from the ceiling, with a black bulb at the end covered by a purple mesh, akin to a bug zapper. When organic movement is detected, it fires purple electric discharges at the target. These turrets are typically found in Xen's floating islands and are designed to protect key areas from intruders. Despite their formidable appearance, they can be destroyed with any weapon and emit a burst of purple smoke upon destruction.

TIPS:

- Approach cautiously to avoid triggering the turret.
- Utilize ranged weapons to disable them from a safe distance.
- Be mindful of their placement in areas with limited cover.
