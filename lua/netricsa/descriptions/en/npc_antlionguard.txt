DESCRIPTION:

The Antlion Guard is the towering enforcer of the hive, feared for its sheer strength and fury. Nearly impervious to conventional gunfire, it relies on raw power to crush intruders-charging at high speed, smashing obstacles, and even flinging debris as weapons. Though terrifying, its death is highly valuable, as it yields the pheropod gland that grants humans control over lesser antlions. Guards are rarely encountered alone; their presence signals the heart of an antlion hive.

TIPS:

- Keep moving-never let it corner you.
- Use heavy weapons or environmental hazards.
- Defeating one grants control over the swarm.
