DESCRIPTION:

The Baby Gargantua is what happens when a Gargantua skips a few evolutionary steps. It still has a penchant for fire and smashing things, but its short temper is usually more hilarious than deadly. Think of it as a pyromaniac toddler with super strength.

Baby Gargantuas are often seen walking around after larger ones or imitating them in chaotic, adorable destruction. in packs, these little firebugs can create chaos almost as efficiently as their parents.

TIPS:

- Don't underestimate cuteness - it comes with smoke and fire.
- Grouping them can make a small encounter surprisingly messy.
- Environmental hazards like collapsing structures can help even the odds.
