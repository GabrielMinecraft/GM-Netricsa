DESCRIPTION:

Stalkers are among the most horrifying results of the Combine's experiments on human prisoners. Once free men and women, they have been mutilated, lobotomized, and rebuilt into cyborg drones. Their eyes are replaced with metal shutters, mouths sealed, and bodies twisted with augmentations that strip them of autonomy.

Primarily used in Nova Prospekt and Citadel facilities, Stalkers serve as construction drones and prison wardens. They operate machinery, maintain technology, and enforce Combine dominance. When threatened, they unleash searing beams from their laser cutters, capable of slicing through resistance fighters and even light cover.

Their presence is a grim reminder of the Combine's cruelty - that a human fate can be reduced to a tool of oppression, with no identity left but obedience.

TIPS:

- Aim for the exposed head and torso.
- Stalkers are often found in fortified areas; expect Combine support units nearby.
