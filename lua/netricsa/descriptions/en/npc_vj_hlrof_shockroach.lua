DESCRIPTION:

The Shock Roach is a living biological weapon developed by Race X and commonly wielded by Shock Troopers. When bonded to a host, the roach functions as an organic firearm, firing concentrated blasts of bio-electric energy. The symbiosis is mutually beneficial: the trooper gains ranged power, while the roach feeds from the host's metabolism.

If a Shock Trooper is killed, the Shock Roach detaches and continues to fight independently. On its own, it is far less accurate and durable but still capable of attacking nearby targets with a desperate bite.

Some Shock Roaches are known to exhibit mutations, altering their energy output. Yellow variants have been documented, firing more potent electrical discharges than the standard blue strain.

TIPS:

- Isolate and destroy detached Shock Roaches quickly-they are fragile but dangerous if ignored.
- Yellow Shock Roaches should be considered priority threats due to their stronger blasts.
- Without a host, they are slow and vulnerable-exploit this weakness.
