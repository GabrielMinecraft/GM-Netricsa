DESCRIPTION:

In certain operations, Justin Barns is deployed with an experimental HEV suit, granting him much higher durability and combat effectiveness compared to standard guards. This armor allows him to withstand Xen environments and resist heavy enemy fire.

With the HEV suit's support, Barns becomes a stronger ally, able to engage both aliens and soldiers on more even footing. His arsenal is expanded, and he is far more resilient in combat situations, making him a reliable partner in extended operations.

TIPS:

- Use him as a frontline partner - his HEV suit greatly improves survivability.
- Allow him to soak up enemy fire while you flank.
- Best paired with explosives and close support tactics.
