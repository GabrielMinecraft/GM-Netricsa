DESCRIPTION:

Failed Transfers are more mobile (though still slow in general), armed with shotguns, and capable of dealing significant damage if you let them get too close.

Failed Transfers also appear in the Nexus area during major sequences. Even when cut in half, some Zombies continue to pose a threat (body parts may still attack). 

TIPS:

- Shotguns and medium-rate weapons are effective against Failed Transfers.
- Aim for the head or chest - headshots deal extra damage.
