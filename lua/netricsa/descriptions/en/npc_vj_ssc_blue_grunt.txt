DESCRIPTION:

Mental transported these soldiers to Earth from an unknown part of the universe. They were once a race of fearsome warriors but as they conquered more planets than they possibly knew what to do with, they decided to slow down for a while. Most of the population took a long overdue vacation on one of the most beautiful tropical planets in their system; but as they only sunbathed from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., after a few years most of them had no skin left on their bodies.

Their blue color comes from a tragic mistake: instead of sunscreen, they accidentally used industrial blue dye "Sin'ka". This bizarre turn of events made them stand out so much that Mental immediately reassigned them into the ranks of the dreaded LASER-GUNNER corps.

TIPS:

- Try to avoid their fast laser beams.
