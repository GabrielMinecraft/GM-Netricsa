DESCRIPTION:

The H.E.C.U. Robot Grunt is a mechanized replacement for the human soldiers of the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit. Designed for dangerous combat zones like Xen incursions or resonance disaster sites, these machines remove the "human factor" - no fatigue, no hesitation, and no moral concerns.

Their design mimics standard H.E.C.U. troops to intimidate and mislead enemies, but beneath the camouflage lies a reinforced exoskeleton with combat AI that calculates tactics in real-time. Unlike Robo Black Ops Assassins (optimized for stealth), the H.E.C.U. Robot Grunts serve as shock troopers, laying down suppressive fire with inhuman accuracy and endurance.

Rumors in Black Mesa suggest these robots were field-tested during the incident, replacing squads that "never came back." Survivors whisper that their cold, synthetic voices calling out "Target acquired" were the last thing many ever heard.

TIPS:

- Treat them like mini-tanks - direct firefights are suicide.
- explosive ordnance can disable their systems faster than bullets.
- Don't expect them to retreat or surrender - they fight until destroyed.
