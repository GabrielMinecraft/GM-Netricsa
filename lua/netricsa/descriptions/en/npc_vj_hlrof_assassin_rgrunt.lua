DESCRIPTION:

The Robo Black Ops Assassin is an experimental mechanized soldier - a fusion of human combat tactics and robotic endurance. Unlike ordinary Black Ops operatives, these machines are designed for zero hesitation, zero fear, and absolute loyalty to mission parameters.

Their sleek armored exoskeleton mimics the silhouette of a human assassin but conceals advanced targeting arrays and synthetic muscle fibers. They move with uncanny precision, combining the stealth of their human predecessors with the tireless efficiency of machines.

Rumors suggest these units were prototyped by shadow projects tied, intended to replace expendable operatives. Whether human minds are still hidden inside their metal shells remains unknown...

TIPS:

- Treat them as both soldier and machine - they're smart, but also heavily armored.
- Conventional bullets barely slow them down; explosives or energy weapons work best.
- Never underestimate their agility - they can sprint and leap like their human counterparts.
