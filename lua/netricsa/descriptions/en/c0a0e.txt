BLACK MESA, TRAIN - FINAL DESTINATION


Sam, the tram has finally reached its destination - one of Black Mesa's central laboratories. Security systems are unlocking doors, and personnel are preparing for your arrival.

Here's the strange part: according to intercepted comms, they seem to be expecting someone else. Specifically... a scientist named Freeman. Apparently, he works here and was scheduled to arrive at this very sector today. For reasons I cannot fully explain, they are mistaking you for him.

The resemblance is... questionable at best. But these people are clearly too stressed, overworked, or underpaid to notice the difference between a theoretical physicist and a one-man army carrying more firepower than their entire security division.

I advise playing along for now. Their confusion might grant you access to restricted areas without raising alarms. Just try to keep your responses short and... scientific. And Sam - if anyone hands you a crowbar, maybe don't smash the walls immediately.
