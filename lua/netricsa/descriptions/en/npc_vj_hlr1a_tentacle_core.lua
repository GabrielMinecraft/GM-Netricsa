TENTACLE CORE FROM XEN


CLASS:      Tentacle Core
METABOLISM: xenobiological neural cluster
PERCEPTION: controls tentacles via vibration and psionic signals
SIZE:       5-10 ft 
ENDURANCE:  medium
HOSTILITY:  passive (indirect)
WEAPONS:    none (coordinates tentacles)
REWARD:     2500 FC
THREAT:     catastrophic (while tentacles active)

DESCRIPTION:

This isolated mass is the Tentacle Core, the central control unit of all tentacle appendages in its area. Without the core, tentacles are inert, leaving the environment relatively safe. Its appearance resembles a grotesque brain with sensory nodes, perfectly designed to relay signals to each tentacle. Though defenseless on its own, as long as it remains intact, every tentacle connected to it is alive and deadly.

TIPS:

- Focus fire or environmental hazards directly on the core.
- Once destroyed, all active tentacles become useless.
- Approach carefully: even though it looks helpless.
