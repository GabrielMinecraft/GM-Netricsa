BLACK MESA, SURFACE ACCESS PREPARATION


The scientists insist there's no direct path to the surface. The only way forward is through them - but first, you'll need to reach their position.

They've locked themselves on the first floor, behind doors. The only way to join them is by activating the experimental beam generators in this sector, powerful enough to punch a hole through the collapsed wall. The process is unstable, and they can't risk stepping out, so the task falls to you.

Intel update:

Objective: reach the second floor, activate the beam generators, and clear a path to the scientists.

Reward: access to restricted tech. They've authorized you to claim the prototype Tau Cannon stored nearby. Handle with care - it's experimental, volatile, and very effective.

Objective: reach the upper floor alive, unleash a wall-melting death ray, and link up with the scientists. Only then will the exit route to the surface become a reality.
