DESCRIPTION:

The Alpha Bullsquid is a colossal and more terrifying cousin of the standard Bullsquid. Marked by its yellow-and-black carapace, glowing red eyes, and nine powerful tentacle-jaws (compared to the six of its lesser kin), this predator dominates its territory. Its white oral tendrils writhe menacingly before it lunges, while its enhanced toxic spit burns with greater potency, capable of melting through armor and flesh alike. Larger and stronger than a normal Bullsquid, feared even by other alien species. Encountering one is not just dangerous-it's usually fatal.

TIPS:

- It's toxic spit is more accurate and deadlier than a normal Bullsquid's-avoid direct line of sight.
- Keep moving; its enlarged tail swipe has extended reach.
- Heavy explosives or high-caliber weapons are the only safe way to bring it down.
