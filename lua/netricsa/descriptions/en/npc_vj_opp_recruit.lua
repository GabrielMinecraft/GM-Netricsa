DESCRIPTION:

The H.E.C.U. Recruit represents an untrained soldier in the earliest stages of boot camp. Unlike their fully armed counterparts, these recruits lack weapons, armor, or combat readiness. When faced with danger, they panic and flee instead of fighting, often trying to find cover or follow commanding officers.

They symbolize the raw material of the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit - young, inexperienced soldiers not yet hardened by real combat. While harmless individually, their presence highlights the vast machinery of military training that produced the battle-hardened H.E.C.U. marines sent to Black Mesa.

TIPS:

- Recruits will not attack, even if threatened.
