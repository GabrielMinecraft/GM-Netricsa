BLACK MESA, BACK TO OFFICES


These are offices - but not the ones you've seen before. Different layout, same stale coffee smell. Black Mesa really loved its cubicles.

Unfortunately, you're not the only visitor. Mental's troops have already occupied parts of this sector, turning the office maze into a battlefield of overturned desks and shattered glass. Expect heavy resistance in tight corridors.

And then there's him again: the man with the briefcase. Spotted calmly walking through one of the hallways, untouched by the chaos, as if all of this was scheduled.
