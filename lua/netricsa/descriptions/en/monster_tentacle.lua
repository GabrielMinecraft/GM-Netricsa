DESCRIPTION:

The Tentacle is a massive subterranean predator from Xen, encountered in resonance cascade zones where it protrudes from deep pits. Blind, it relies entirely on sound and vibration to locate prey. Any noise will draw its attention instantly, followed by bone-shattering strikes from its whip-like appendages.

Its armored hide makes it virtually invulnerable to conventional weapons. Victims are often pulped into the ground before they even realize they have been detected. The only true way to eliminate it is by destroying its core, buried deep beneath the surface.

TIPS:

- Stay silent - walking, shooting, or even reloading too loudly will get you killed.
- Explosives or energy weapons are ineffective against its armor.
- Patience and stealth are the keys to survival.
