BLACK MESA, RAIL MISSION DIRECTIVE


Before you boarded the train, one of the surviving security guards passed along a message. According to him, an older scientist-someone who seems to know a lot more than he should-insisted that Freeman must reach the missile silos on the far end of the facility.

The objective? Launch a satellite rocket into orbit. The scientist believes this will allow Lambda Sector to stabilize the resonance cascade, or at least weaken the dimensional link flooding the base with alien lifeforms.

Now, whether he mistook you for this "Freeman" person, or simply doesn't care as long as someone gets the job done, doesn't matter. The mission is clear:

Stay on the rail until you reach the missile complex.

Navigate through whatever gauntlet the H.E.C.U. and alien forces put in your way.

Find a way to launch the rocket.

Of course, the catch is obvious: if the army realizes what you're trying to do, they'll throw everything they have to stop you. And judging by the increasing troop movements along the tracks, they already know.
