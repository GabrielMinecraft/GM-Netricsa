DESCRIPTION:

This stationary defense unit, codename HK-707, was originally designed to intercept and destroy incoming rockets before they reach their targets.

The turret locks onto incoming missiles using onboard sensors and radar, firing rapid interceptor bursts to neutralize the threat mid-air. Its external chassis is painted bright orange, marking it as a specialized anti-missile system. However, the unit is single-use: once deployed and activated, it cannot be moved or repaired.

TIPS:

- Destroy the turret before it locks on to your rockets.
- It is most effective at close-to-mid range interception.
- Overwhelm it with explosives to bypass its defenses.
- Once inactive, the unit becomes harmless debris.
