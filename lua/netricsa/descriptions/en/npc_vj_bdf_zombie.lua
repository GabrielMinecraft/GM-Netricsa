DESCRIPTION:

The Headcrab Zombie Runner is a terrifying evolution of the standard Common Headcrab Zombie. While still host-bound to its Headcrab, the Runner is faster, more agile to reach prey. Unlike the original, it can quickly close gaps, making it extremely dangerous in corridors or open combat.

Its human host's body is twisted and contorted, reflecting the violent adaptation imposed by the Headcrab. While its cranium is still visible beneath the parasite, this allows for rapid pursuit and sudden attacks, giving it the nickname "Runner" among survivors.

TIPS:

- Maintain distance - their speed make close encounters deadly.
- Prioritize ranged attacks; melee is highly risky.
- Environmental traps or choke points are effective to slow them down.
