DESCRIPTION:

The Black Mesa Armored Turret is a heavily reinforced automated defense unit designed to secure corridors, laboratories, and sensitive facilities. Unlike standard sentry turrets, it can be mounted both on the ground and inverted on ceilings, allowing for unpredictable firing angles.

Its armored plating provides resistance to small arms, while its rapid-fire heavy machine gun delivers lethal suppressive fire. Deployed in chokepoints or narrow corridors, the turret can control access with devastating efficiency, making ambushes and frontal assaults extremely dangerous.

TIPS:

- Aim for structural weak points; armor protects most frontal areas.
- Explosives or heavy firepower are effective against it.
- Watch for ceiling-mounted turrets - always check above.
- Avoid staying in open spaces; their fields of fire are deadly.
