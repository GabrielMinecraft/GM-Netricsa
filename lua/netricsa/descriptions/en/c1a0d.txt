BLACK MESA, CORRIDORS


Sam, you've been redirected to the equipment room. According to Black Mesa protocols, no personnel are allowed into the test chamber without wearing their HEV protective suit. Apparently, this is standard procedure for handling hazardous experiments - though I doubt even they fully grasp the scale of what they're about to unleash.

The HEV Mark IV suit is impressive by human standards: it provides environmental shielding, strength augmentation, integrated health monitoring, and even voice-assisted systems. Not as flexible as your usual combat gear, but given the situation, it's a useful upgrade. More importantly, the guards won't let you proceed without it.

And yes - the staff still believes you're Dr. Freeman. Either their eyesight is compromised, or you've suddenly developed a reputation for carrying rocket launchers into physics experiments. In any case, I recommend playing along. The HEV suit may become essential very soon... because the energy readings from their upcoming test are spiking into levels that no lab on Earth should be touching.
