DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Sniper Soldier Elite represents the pinnacle of the Combine's long-range infantry. Unlike their standard counterparts, these elites are equipped with advanced stealth uniforms that appear nearly transparent in certain lighting conditions. In reality, the armor is jet black - their only consistently visible features are a brown tactical mask, black gloves, heavy boots, ammunition belts, and the menacing glow of their yellow visor lenses.

Designed for both psychological warfare and absolute battlefield control, the Sniper Elite is capable of eliminating priority targets before they even realize they're under surveillance. Their enhanced optics allow them to see through fog, smoke, and even partial cover, making them nearly impossible to hide from.

They are typically deployed in high-value operations: assassinations, suppression of rebel leaders, and overwatch in prison complexes like Nova Prospekt. Their presence alone can destabilize resistance morale, as even seasoned fighters know a single mistake in movement could be their last.

TIPS:

- Their yellow visors are the only reliable way to spot them at a distance.
- Do not attempt to duel them in open ground - flank or use explosives.
- Their camouflage fails under bright light or thermal optics.
- Once their nest is discovered, press aggressively before they relocate.
