DESCRIPTION:

When a Fast Zombie is severed in battle, the nightmare doesn't end. The headcrab refuses to relinquish control, forcing the mutilated torso of its host to crawl with horrifying agility. These half-forms retain the speed and frenzy of their full-bodied kin, launching themselves forward with shrill, bone-chilling screams. While fragile and easily dispatched, their erratic lunges in confined spaces can catch even seasoned fighters off guard.

TIPS:

- Stay mobile-they can still kill despite missing limbs.
- Don't waste heavy ammo; one or two shots is enough.
- The screams announce their presence-use that to prepare.
