DESCRIPTION:

New Npc is a template NPC included in the Source SDK—essentially a skeleton or placeholder for modders to build new AI characters from. 

On its own, it has very minimal functionality: a dummy model reference (“models/mymodel.mdl”) that often results in an “error” model if not replaced. 

It inherits base NPC capabilities (movement, sight, etc.) via the class hierarchy CAI_BaseNPC → CBaseCombatCharacter → etc. 

Flags and behaviors can be customized via keyvalues (e.g. relationships, squad name, wake radius) to create more advanced NPC types. 

In code, New Npc is used as a starting point: modders copy npc_newnpc code (in npc_new.cpp) and replace class names, model paths, tasks, schedules, etc. to make a fully functional NPC. 


TIPS:

- Use New Npc as a foundation when designing new custom NPCs.
