DESCRIPTION:

Originally giant worms native to the planet Magnor, Albino Cyclopes were horrifyingly transformed by Mental-given arms and legs in a twisted genetic experiment. Their bodies didn't quite get the memo, so they remain gruesomely large and oddly proportioned. They strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest with two signature attacks:

Orb blast: Fires a homing energy sphere that locks onto players - evasive maneuvers are essential.

Arm smash: If you're foolish enough to get too close, prepare to get clubbed with cavernous strength.

TIPS:

- Large size means they're easy targets for rocket launchers and grenade launchers.
- Use weapons like the Clawdovic, rockets, or heavy firearms for quick takedowns.
- A perfect shot from the SBC Cannon can obliterate one outright if you're lucky.
