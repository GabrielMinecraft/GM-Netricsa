DESCRIPTION:

Native to the border world of Xen, the natives of the border world of Xen, having found themselves on earth, mutated, becoming parasites that can jump off their hosts. Headcrabs are small parasitic organisms designed by evolution to enslave larger hosts. They leap with surprising force, latching onto the skull and driving their beak directly into the nervous system. The host remains alive but stripped of control, transformed into a zombie under the parasite's command. While individually weak, their erratic jumps and tendency to swarm make them far more dangerous than their size suggests.

TIPS:

- Keep moving; their leaps are predictable but fast.
- A single shotgun blast is usually enough.
