DESCRIPTION:

Blue H.E.V. Security officers are specialized Black Mesa guards outfitted with prototype Hazardous Environment suits. Their gear provides superior durability compared to standard security personnel, allowing them to survive in hostile zones longer and resist light alien or military fire.

Though less trained than military forces, they are loyal defenders of Black Mesa and often stand their ground against Xen creatures, H.E.C.U., or hostile operatives. Their distinct blue HEV armor makes them recognizable on the field.

TIPS:

- Don't rely on him as a tank - he's brave, but human.
- Listen to their screams carefully - they might indicate nearby danger.
