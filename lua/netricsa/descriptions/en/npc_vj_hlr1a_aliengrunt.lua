DESCRIPTION:

Alien Grunts are mass-produced foot soldiers of Xen, essentially built in factories as obedient shock troops. Their leathery, humanoid bodies are equipped with organic arm cannons that shoot swarming Hornets - a built-in projectile weapon that relentlessly seeks targets.

Although individually not very smart, Grunts are terrifying in groups. They patrol Xen corridors with precision, often guided by Controllers to enforce alien law. Their slightly controller-like faces give them a bizarrely menacing aura, like a grumpy factory guy with deadly toys.

TIPS:

- Hornet fire is fast and persistent â€” keep moving to avoid being overwhelmed.
- Explosives or concentrated fire work better than single shots.
