DESCRIPTION:

Generic Actors are mysterious xenobiological entities that hide beneath familiar faces. No one knows where they come from - some speculate they originated in Xen, others say they're a byproduct of the resonance cascade - but one thing is certain: they can perfectly mimic any being.

They appear as scientists, security guards, or even monsters, blending seamlessly into Black Mesa or Xen populations. While their outward appearance may seem harmless, they are unpredictable and dangerous, often using whatever abilities their current guise provides.

Their true form is unknown; some researchers suggest it might be a shapeless mass of living psionic tissue, capable of scanning and replicating biological and behavioral patterns. Encountering one is like shaking hands with a stranger who might bite.

TIPS:

- Don't trust appearances - any familiar face could be a Generic Actor.
- Observe behavior carefully; inconsistencies may reveal the disguise.
- Be ready for sudden attacks from unexpected sources.
