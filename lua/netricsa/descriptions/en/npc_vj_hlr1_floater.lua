DESCRIPTION:

The Flocking Floater is a strange airborne lifeform native to Xen. Its body is a bulbous sac, filled with lighter-than-air gases that allow it to hover effortlessly. Large wing-like membranes stabilize its movement, while its antennae sense vibrations and chemical traces in the air. Normally calm, the Floater becomes aggressive when threatened. In such cases, groups of them swarm together, spitting jets of corrosive acid from their mouths at the attacker. Their poisonous spines act as a deterrent against close contact, making them dangerous in numbers.

TIPS:

- They rarely attack alone; expect multiple Floaters when one is provoked.
- Their acidic spit is accurate at mid-range.
- Best neutralized quickly before the swarm forms around you.
