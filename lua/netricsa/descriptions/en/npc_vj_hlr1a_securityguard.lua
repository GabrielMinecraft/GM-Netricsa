DESCRIPTION:

The Alpha Security Guards were the first wave of government forces deployed to Black Mesa following the Resonance Cascade. Unlike later H.E.C.U. units, their orders prioritized containment and survival, not eradication of witnesses. Upon arrival, they quickly realized the critical danger beneath the facility: a concealed missile installation, armed and unstable. Any miscalculation could detonate the warhead and annihilate Black Mesa entirely.
Recognizing the severity of the situation, the Alpha Guards set aside differences and worked side by side with scientists and on-site security personnel. Together they attempted to hold the lines against Xen creatures and maintain control of vital sectors of the facility, hoping to prevent total destruction. Though lightly equipped compared to later reinforcements, their determination to stabilize the crisis made them an essential part of Black Mesa's fragile defense.

TIPS:
