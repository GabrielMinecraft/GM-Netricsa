DESCRIPTION:

The Zombine is what happens when a headcrab decides that turning a Combine soldier into a puppet is a good idea. And apparently, the soldier`s combat training sticks around just enough to make things worse. Unlike regular zombies, Zombines sometimes pull out a live grenade and sprint at their enemies like some kind of undead suicide bomber.

They still groan and stumble, but with that grenade in hand, suddenly they have everyones attention. Its unclear whether this tactic comes from the headcrabs ingenuity or just dumb luck, but either way, it works. Resistance fighters have coined the term **Zombine** half out of fear, half because its darkly funny.

TIPS:

- When they pull out a grenade, either shoot the explosive or get out of there.
- Keep distance: claws and explosions are a bad mix.
- If you hear a muffled clink of granade... start running.
