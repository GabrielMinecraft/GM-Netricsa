DESCRIPTION:

Grunt is a humanoid Strogg, man-sized, with ape-like build, sharp teeth, three eyes, and green stroyent canisters along arms and back. 


They prefer charging into melee-punching or pouncing at the enemy. They sometimes use a shoulder gun to fire from a distance, but that’s rare. When sufficiently damaged, they can “frenzy" - injecting stroyent from their canisters, boosting health and melee damage. While in frenzy, they roar and glow green.



TIPS:

- Keep your distance; their melee charge is dangerous.
- Use shotgun or machine gun, aim for head.
- Don't allow them to close in, use mobility and ranged attacks.
