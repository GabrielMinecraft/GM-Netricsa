BLACK MESA, DERAILMENT


Sam, congratulations - the rocket is away. Sensors confirm successful ignition, guidance stable, trajectory clean. For once, something in this cursed facility actually worked as intended. Don't get too comfortable, though - victory in Black Mesa never lasts more than five minutes.

You've boarded another freight line to continue toward Lambda. At first, the ride feels almost peaceful compared to the chaos behind you. The tunnels echo with the rumble of wheels, and for a second it almost feels like progress.

Structural scans show the rail ahead is compromised. Before you can react, the tracks give way, and the entire train car plunges into black water below.

The good news: you're still alive. The bad news: the car is sinking fast, and hostile signatures are converging on the waterâ€™s surface. You'll need to fight your way out before you drown or get dragged under.
