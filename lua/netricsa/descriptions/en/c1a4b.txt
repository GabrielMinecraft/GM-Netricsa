BLACK MESA, OUTSIDE OF REACTOR PIT


Sam, you've surfaced into one of the facility's largest structures-an industrial cistern wrapped around a nuclear test reactor. From the outside it looks like a concrete fortress, but inside... it's a nightmare symphony of steel, echo, and claws.

Sensors confirm the presence of Tentacle-class organisms. Imagine a skyscraper-sized plant whip with perfect hearing and a bad attitude, and you'll get the idea. These things don't see-you make noise, and they strike. Hard. The shockwave alone can turn your ribs into gravel.

To complicate matters, means you're dealing with crossfire from above-Mental's guys - patrol the perimeter, and they don't care if the tentacles hit you first. To them, you're just target practice.

Navigation hazard: the reactor itself. Power surges from the cascade have destabilized its systems, so certain areas are lit up with radiation spikes. Think of it as an obstacle course designed by a lunatic physicist.
