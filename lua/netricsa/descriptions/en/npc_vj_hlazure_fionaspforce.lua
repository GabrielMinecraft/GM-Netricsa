DESCRIPTION:

Fiona is the commander of the Black Ops Assassin division, a ruthless leader directing covert operations during the Black Mesa Incident. Unlike standard assassins, she operates at the highest level, directly coordinating with both Sector Delta Special Forces and the mysterious man in the business suit with a briefcase.

Her squad specializes in surgical strikes, intelligence retrieval, and total elimination of witnesses. Fiona herself is faster, deadlier, and far more disciplined than regular assassins, embodying the precision of Black Ops command. Her partnership with the mysterious man in the business suit associates suggests she is deeply embedded in the larger interdimensional agenda behind the incident.

TIPS:

- Never fight her head-on; she is highly evasive.
- Expect ambushes - she rarely attacks without squad support.
- Watch for coordinated strikes with Sector Delta forces.
- Her alliance with the briefcase man hints at objectives beyond simple combat.
