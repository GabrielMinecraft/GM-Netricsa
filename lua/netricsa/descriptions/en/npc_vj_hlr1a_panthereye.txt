PROTO-PANTHEREYE FROM XEN


CLASS:      Proto-Panthereye (Xen Predator, Early Subspecies)
METABOLISM: Incomplete hybridization of Xen beast DNA
PERCEPTION: Sharp vision, basic predatory instincts
SIZE:       ~5 ft tall (smaller than mature Panthereye)
ENDURANCE:  Medium-Low
HOSTILITY:  Moderate
WEAPONS:    Leaping bite, Basic claw strikes, Limited energy discharge (unstable, short range)
REWARD:     500 FC
THREAT:     Moderate

DESCRIPTION:

The Early Alpha Panthereye represents an unstable, prototype version of the Panthereye species, observed during its formative evolutionary stages. Unlike the fully developed Panthereye, this subspecies lacks refined musculature, its hide appears uneven.

Its body is leaner and less armored, with jagged bone growths protruding from its limbs - evidence of incomplete genetic stability. Although smaller than its later counterparts, the Early Alpha Panthereye is still dangerous, relying on savage lunges and frantic attacks to overwhelm prey.

Specimens of this kind are believed to have been early experiments by Xen's adaptive ecosystem, possibly predating the perfected Panthereye lineage. Some researchers theorize that unstable hybrids like this one paved the way for more advanced monstrosities.

TIPS:

- Less durable than a full Panthereye, but faster and more erratic.
