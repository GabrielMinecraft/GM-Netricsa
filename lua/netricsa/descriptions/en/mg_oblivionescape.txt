OBLIVION DEADLANDS, ESCAPE THROUGH THE GATES


So... apparently, running from alien warlords and angry soldiers wasn’t enough. Now we've stumbled straight into the Deadlands of Mehrunes Dagon. And let me tell you: this place makes Sirius in its worst days look like a sunny vacation resort.

Here's the situation. The only way out is to activate an Oblivion Gate, and to do that you'll need to collect three Soul Stones placed around the towering figure of Dagon himself. Easy to say... not so easy to do.

Expect "fun" local hazards: spike traps that seem allergic to your legs, rolling boulders with perfect timing, nasty little Clannfears that won't stop chasing you, and flaming towers that belch lava just to remind you that this world hates you. Honestly, even Mental’s planets had more safety regulations.

Bottom line: grab the stones, survive the playground of pain, and light up the Gate. Compared to this place, even a Kleer stampede feels like a warm hug.
