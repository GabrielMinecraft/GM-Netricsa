DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Claw Scanner, also known as the Shield Scanner or Scanner Type II, is a sinister combat-ready variation of the standard City Scanner. Outfitted with a hidden pincer arm, it can deploy lethal Hopper Mines into narrow corridors, alleyways, and other strategic areas to block or ambush resistance forces.

Like its civilian counterpart, it can emit a blinding flash with its camera system, used to disorient targets or force them from cover. These drones support Striders and ground units by marking targets and restricting civilian movement, giving the Combine a relentless eye in the sky.

TIPS:

- The scanner's flash can incapacitate - avoid looking directly when it charges.
- Heavy fire or explosives will disable it and prevent further mine drops.
- These units are often seen in groups or near Combine defensive positions.
