BLACK MESA, TENTACLE CHAMBER CORE


Sam, the purge sequence was a success. The reactor fire did its job, and the massive tentacle that ruled this silo is now nothing more than charred alien calamari. Its body collapsed into the depths, leaving behind only its grotesque core, still twitching with residual energy.

From here, the environment shifts. The outer basin surrounding the silo is partially flooded, and containment systems have failed. Radioactive waste barrels-bright yellow, conveniently glowing-are slowly drifting in a circular current around the chamber. This is less of a waste-disposal system and more of a deadly carousel.

Hazards:

Recommendation: keep moving along the narrow ledges. Do not swim, do not touch the barrels, and definitely don't think about fishing. With the tentacle dead, your path forward is open-but Black Mesa isn't running out of horrors anytime soon.
