DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Shotgun Soldier is a brutal close-range enforcer designed for urban suppression and corridor combat. Outfitted with heavier body armor and enhanced muscle augmentations, these soldiers thrive in confined environments where their devastating shotguns can instantly annihilate unprepared enemies.

Unlike standard Overwatch units, Shotgun Soldiers are programmed for relentless aggression, often charging headlong into enemy positions to maximize the destructive potential of their weaponry.

They form the spearhead of Combine assaults, breaking resistance lines before the more organized transhuman infantry moves in to secure territory. While their heavy armor and devastating firepower make them formidable, they are far less effective at medium or long range, relying heavily on ambushes and aggressive maneuvers.

TIPS:

- Keep your distance - their shotguns dominate at close range.
- Explosives are effective against groups of Shotgun Soldiers.
- Avoid tight hallways if you know they're nearby.
