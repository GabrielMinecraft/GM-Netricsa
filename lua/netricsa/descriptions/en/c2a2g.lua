BLACK MESA, SNIPER'S PERCH


Sam, finally some good news. The interference cloud is dissipating - my full sensor suite is back online. I can once again read terrain, structures, and long-range activity. Translation: you're no longer flying blind.

However, the situation topside is... complicated. Intelligence traffic confirms that both the H.E.C.U. and Black Ops are converging on your location. Everyone is still talking about "Freeman" being the key factor in all this chaos. Guess what, Sam - they're talking about you. Either nobody bothered to check IDs, or the universe just thinks "One man army with questionable fashion sense" is a universal constant.

As for the immediate threat: sensors picked up a stationary H.E.C.U. sniper organism, camouflaged against the rock wall. Locals are calling it the Stone Sniper. Highly accurate, highly dangerous, and not something you want to peek at twice.

Complicating matters further, two H.E.C.U. soldiers nearby were  discussing Freeman. They're under orders to capture or eliminate you on sight. Clearly, your legend precedes you - just not in a way that helps.

Recommendation: keep your head low, spot the sniper before he spots you, and remember - whether they call you Freeman or Sam, a bullet to the skull doesn't care about names. being the key factor in all this chaos.
