BLACK MESA, MANTA


like things weren't already messy enough, the desert sky just had to add flair. A Skat-manta swooped overhead, dropped a squad of Xen infantry onto, and vanished before you could even get a proper lock on it. Now the roofs are alive with aliens, and every so often an arachnoid clambers up from the shadows - zealous warriors of the "sacred order" who pledged themselves to Mental for reasons only theology could explain.

The ground? Forget it. The courtyard is mined, but whoever planted the charges was in a playful mood - no patterns, no markers, just invisible death waiting underfoot.

And just when you think you’ve mapped every threat, there's movement in the upper windows. One frame is blacker than the rest, and inside that void perches something still, heavy, and wrong: a Stone Sniper. It hasn’t fired yet, but the weight of its gaze is enough to make even trained soldiers hesitate.

Threat summary:

Skat-manta drop: Xen troops now patrol zone.

Arachnoids: strike from roofs and walls, religious fervor making them fight to the last breath.

Minefield: invisible, randomized placement, guarantees panic if you rush.

Stone Sniper: entrenched in a dark window, line of sight on the whole approach. Expect devastating accuracy once it decides to strike.

Tactical advice:

Roofs are kill-zones - clear them before you attempt the minefield.

Use debris, grenades, or even corpses to check mined paths. Anything's better than your boots.
