DESCRIPTION:

This Mossman-skinned Example NPC is a placeholder humanoid used for testing and development. Though she looks like the Black Mesa scientist ally, she performs scripted behaviors only-standing, walking, turning, or reacting to triggers. She does not attack, but she can open doors, walk through rooms, and provide visual presence for demos.

Think of her as a training dummy with Mossman cosplay: harmless, occasionally awkward, and perfect for checking animations or environmental interactions.

TIPS:

- Useful for testing AI behavior without adding real threats.
- Can trigger scripted events or follow waypoints.
- Great for seeing how humanoid models interact with the environment.
