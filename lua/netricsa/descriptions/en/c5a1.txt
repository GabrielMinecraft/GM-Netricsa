XEN, AFTERMATH


The Nihilanth is dead. The rift is closed. Xen falls silent...

But before you can even catch your breath, reality flickers and you're pulled out of the battlefield. You reappear in a sterile, endless void. A man in a cheap business suit stands before you, briefcase in hand, smile faint but razor-sharp.

He informs you that all your weapons, your H.E.V. suit - even your underwear - have been confiscated. "Government property," he says, "belonging to an entity, Prospero". His tone is polite, but every word feels like a contract you never signed.

Then he starts talking about you. He calls you "FREEMAN", a name you're beginning to hate. He praises your performance, admires your efficiency, and yet every compliment sounds like a cage.

He offers you a choice:

Stay here, unarmed, surrounded by aliens who will probably tear you apart.

Or step into a glowing, humming stasis portal, where you'll "wait" until his employers decide to wake you. Could be tomorrow. Could be never.

The man waits. The portal pulses. Time to choose.
