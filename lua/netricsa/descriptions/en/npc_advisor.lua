DESCRIPTION:

Combine Advisors are the true overseers of the Earth occupation, rarely seen by common soldiers but deeply feared even among the Overwatch. These grotesque, slug-like beings float through a field of psionic energy, their bodies bloated and sustained by alien technology.

They command Combine forces through telepathic networks, extending their will directly into transhuman soldiers and enslaved humans alike. In combat, they unleash terrifying psionic powers - halting foes mid-step, crushing them with invisible force, or slamming them against walls. Their feeding proboscis is capable of piercing skulls and extracting neural matter, a process used both for sustenance and interrogation.

Though rarely exposed on the battlefield, when Advisors appear, it signals absolute Combine dominance in the area. Their presence means no action goes unseen and no resistance can last long.

TIPS:

- Avoid direct eye contact; psionic lock weakens resistance.
