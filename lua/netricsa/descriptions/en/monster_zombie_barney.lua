DESCRIPTION:

Zombie Security Guard is a former Black Mesa security guard infected by a common Headcrab. Once friendly and loyal, he now shuffles aimlessly through the facility, attacking anything that moves. The security armor is partially fused with alien tissue, adding a grotesque appearance but offering minimal protection.

Despite their slow speed, Zombie Security Guards are relentless, often cornering intruders in hallways and service areas. The sight of a former ally turned monster serves as a grim reminder of Xen's parasitic cruelty.

TIPS:

- Keep your distance; melee attacks are dangerous.
- Firearms are effective due to their slow pace.
