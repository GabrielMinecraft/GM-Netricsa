BLACK MESA, WASTE COMPACTOR


Sam, your "Allies" in the H.E.C.U. just gave you a first-class ticket straight into a garbage compactor.

This chamber was designed to obliterate industrial debris, but today it's being repurposed for you. Hydraulic crushers slam with enough force to turn tanks into pancakes, and the grinding belts show no mercy to anything caught between them. Even Mental's biomechanoids would be scrap in seconds.

Telemetry notes no immediate exits there - translation: they expected you to die here. But scanners do pick up maintenance shafts, weak grates, and utility conduits. In other words, there is a way out, but you'll need speed, timing, and probably a miracle. Jump on the boxes.

Recommendation: stay alert, avoid the crushers, and look for unstable structures you can exploit. The H.E.C.U. think they've taken you off the board. Prove them wrong. Again.
