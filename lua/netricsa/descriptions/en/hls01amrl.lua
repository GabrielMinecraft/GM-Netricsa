BLACK MESA, ANOMALOUS MATERIALS


Sam, you've reached the Anomalous Materials sector - the heart of Black Mesa's research program. From intercepted communications, this entire department is preparing for a large-scale experiment today. The staff is rushing about, technicians are making last-minute adjustments, and scientists are whispering nervously about "resonance parameters."

What's more curious - they are still convinced you're Dr. Freeman, one of their theoretical physicists. That would be amusing if it weren't so dangerous: these people are about to hand you access to equipment that can destabilize entire universes, and they think youâ€™re here to run the show.

For now, your task is simple: follow their directions, observe carefully, and try not to break anything until we understand what's going on. Black Mesa clearly doesn't realize what they're dealing with - but I suspect Mental does.
