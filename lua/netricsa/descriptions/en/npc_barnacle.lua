DESCRIPTION:

The Barnacle is a stationary predator native to Xen, often found hanging from ceilings, caves, and industrial structures. It extends a long, sticky tongue that dangles toward the ground, waiting for anything to brush against it. Once contact is made, the victim is reeled upward toward a maw of jagged teeth, where it is crushed and devoured whole. While immobile and predictable, barnacles are deadly to the unwary-especially in tight corridors or when victims are distracted by other threats.

TIPS:

- Look up-barnacles are easiest to spot from a distance.
- Use them against enemies: lure zombies or Combine into their tongues.
- Short, controlled fire will kill them quickly.
