DESCRIPTION:

The Fisherman appears as a gruff but caring local who helps Gordon Freeman. Recognizing Gordon as "that scientist chap", he unlocks a gate, arms himself with his harpoon, and guides Freeman toward eliminating a Combine Headcrab Shell launcher threatening nearby St. Olga.

Even more touching than his actions are his words. He worries about the creatures still surviving Earth's changed ecosystem-warning Gordon not to shoot the seagulls because "they keep down the leech population", lamenting that "we've lost enough species already".

TIPS:

- He's unreliable in combat, but invaluable as a local guide.
