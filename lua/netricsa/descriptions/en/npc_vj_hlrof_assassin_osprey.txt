DESCRIPTION:

The Black Ops Osprey is a modified V-22 used by covert operatives for insertion missions. Unlike the standard H.E.C.U. transport, this version often deploys elite assassins or demolition squads. Its darkened hull, advanced avionics, and reinforced armor make it a harder target to bring down.

While it rarely engages directly, it sometimes mounts defensive side guns to suppress attackers during troop deployment. Its true lethality is in the soldiers it delivers: Black Ops units trained for surgical strikes and total elimination of survivors. Seeing one in the skies usually signals the beginning of a massacre.

TIPS:

- Prioritize destroying before it can drop troops.
- Black Ops operatives are deadlier than marines - don't underestimate.
- Rockets, mounted turrets, or heavy explosives are required to bring it down.
- If it lands, expect a stealthy but devastating assault.
