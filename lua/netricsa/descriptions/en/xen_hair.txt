DESCRIPTION:

Xen Hair, also known as Xen Cilia, is a plantlike organism native to the border world Xen. It looks superficially like black hair, waving gently in breeze or environmental currents. It has does not respond to the entities presence; it simply flaps in the wind.

These organisms are commonly found near Healing Pools or in damp, wild regions of Xen. They may grow singly or in small clusters (up to about four). Their presence adds atmospheric detail to Xen's landscapes. 

TIPS:

- They are purely decorative - harming them yields no gain.
