DESCRIPTION:

The Merkava Tank is a formidable rebel-engineered war machine, designed to counter the technological dominance of the Combine. With a reinforced chassis and thick armor plating, it is capable of withstanding heavy assaults while delivering devastating firepower in return.

Its primary weapon is a rocket-launching cannon, able to obliterate even the largest of Combine synths in a single barrage. On top of the vehicle sits an open gunner's cabin, where a rebel operates a high-caliber machine gun, mowing down infantry and providing suppressive fire.

Although slower than lighter vehicles, the Merkava's durability and sheer firepower make it a cornerstone of rebel armored divisions. Its presence on the battlefield is both a morale boost to allies and a nightmare to the Combine.

TIPS:

- Heavy explosives or Striders are most effective against it.
- Never underestimate the machine gunner's field of fire.
