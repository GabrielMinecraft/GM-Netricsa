DESCRIPTION:

Light Guards are the most basic and common Strogg. They are naked, stroggified humans with mechanical legs and a blaster in their right arm. Their blue-grey mechanical parts distinguish them visually from other guard types. 

Although weak and lightly armored, they show up in large numbers and can still be dangerous if underestimated. Their 5-round blaster bursts are modest in damage, but in tight corridors or when multiple guards attack together, they can overwhelm. 

TIPS:

- Use any weapon - they are fragile.
- Explosives and area effect weapons can clear groups efficiently.
- Prioritize them early in fights so they donâ€™t distract you while dealing with stronger Strogg.
