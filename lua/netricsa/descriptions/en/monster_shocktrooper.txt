DESCRIPTION:

Shock Troopers are the primary infantry of Race X, bred as elite soldiers and battlefield commanders. Towering and muscular, their bodies are armored with natural chitin plating, giving them impressive resilience against conventional weapons. Their signature weapon is the Shock Roach, a living bio-organism that serves as an energy blaster. The trooper and roach share a symbiotic bond-when the trooper falls, the roach detaches and continues to fight as an independent creature.

Shock Troopers also employ Pit Drones as support units, driving them forward as expendable scouts and frontline attackers. Their tactics are organized and efficient, unlike the feral aggression of Xen fauna. In combat, Shock Troopers advance steadily, laying down bio-electric fire and using their bulk to crush foes in melee.

Their presence on Earth during the Black Mesa Incident was a sign that Race X sought full-scale invasion, rivaling Xen itself.

TIPS:

- Prioritize the Shock Roach-the weapon is powerful but has a limited fire pattern.
- Explosives and heavy weapons work best against their thick armor.
- Be ready to deal with detached Shock Roaches after the trooper dies.
- Avoid close quarters-they excel in melee if allowed to close distance.
- Rare orange-skinned Shock Troopers may appear; these are stronger and more resilient than their green counterparts.
