DESCRIPTION:

Worker Drones are standard civilian drones. They are designed for maintenance, logistics, and manual labor aboard facilities or urban environments. Completely non-combative, they actively avoid conflict and flee from any hostile entity, with the exception of their own kind.

Although defenseless, Worker Drones serve as a visual indicator of environmental hazards and enemy presence. Observing their behavior can warn  of nearby threats, making them surprisingly useful despite their passive nature.

TIPS:

- Worker Drones are harmless and may provide narrative or environmental context.
