DESCRIPTION:

Scientists are the fragile, yet crucial, denizens of Black Mesa. They spend most of their time analyzing, measuring, and panicking appropriately when things go wrong - which, thanks to the resonance cascade, happens a lot. Despite their lack of combat ability, their knowledge can be invaluable: they might point you to important locations, provide health kits, or unlock doors.

While harmless, their shrill screams and tendency to run in unpredictable patterns can sometimes make navigating the facility a chaotic experience. Some theorists joke that a single Scientistâ€™s panic is capable of attracting more monsters than a full squad of security guards.

TIPS:

- Protect them if possible - they often have useful information.
- Don't expect them to fight; avoid using them as shields.
- Listen to their screams carefully - they might indicate nearby danger.
