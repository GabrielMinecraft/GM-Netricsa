BLACK MESA LAMBDA COMPLEX, ENTRANCE TO LAMBDA REACTOR COMPLEX


The final threshold before Lambda isn't guarded by Marines, or even by Mental's creatures - it's Black Ops assassins.

No chatter, no taunts, no wasted movement: just shadows flickering between steel beams and the whisper of suppressed gunfire. This isn't a brawl, it's a duel, and the price for a single mistake is death.

They know you're coming. They've set ambush points across the approach, using height and silence to their advantage. But once they fall, the path is clear. There will be no more soldiers beyond this point. H.E.C.U. has failed. Black Ops has made its strike. And now the reactor doors stand unguarded, waiting to be breached.

From here on, your enemies will no longer wear uniforms. The battlefield shifts inward - to Xen, to portals, to what's left of Mental's forces. Humanityâ€™s war is over. Something older, stranger, and far deadlier waits beyond.
