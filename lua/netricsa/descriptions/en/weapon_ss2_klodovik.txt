CLAWDOVIC


WEAPON: Clawdovic
AMMO:   Itself 
ROF:    ~60 Clawdovics/minute 

DESCRIPTION:


The Clawdovic is a psychotic kamikaze parrot armed with a bomb. Despite its somewhat awkward appearance, this bird is capable of knocking down even rhinoceroses. In flight, it screeches something unintelligible (Kurly...), but it seems to be legible...

This is a bird-bioweapon from planet M'Digbo, used by the Simbas. It has been modified using a poisonous flower to turn its stomach into a bomb that explodes on impact. When thrown, Clawdovic acts like a homing projectile: it flies toward the enemy the user is looking at.

NOTES:

- Homing ability is imperfect: on medium to long distances, sudden movement of the target can cause Clawdovic to miss or fly off-course. 
- Using it at close range can lead to self-damage from the explosion. 
- Very effective vs boss-type enemies and large or airborne targets like the Albino Cyclops or attack helicopters. 
- Limited ammo supply makes every.
