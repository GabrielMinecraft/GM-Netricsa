DESCRIPTION:

The Human Assassin is a member of the shadowy Black Ops unit, deployed to Black Mesa after the H.E.C.U. fails. Unlike standard soldiers, assassins are elite killers trained for stealth, sabotage, and silent elimination of targets. They move with terrifying speed, using acrobatics and wall-leaps to disorient opponents.

Dressed in sleek black suits with night-ops gear, they often strike from the shadows and vanish before retaliation. Unlike H.E.C.U. grunts, their mission is even darker: eliminate all surviving Black Mesa personnel and clean up the mess left behind, even if it means erasing the H.E.C.U. themselves.

TIPS:

- Keep your ears sharp - their footsteps are faint but can give them away.
- Always look up; assassins love striking from walls or ledges.
- Use explosives or wide-area fire to counter their speed and agility.
